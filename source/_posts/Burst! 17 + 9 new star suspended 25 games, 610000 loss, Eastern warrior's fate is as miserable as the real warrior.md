Terre Yang
However, against the heat, Trey young sprained his right ankle and had to stop when he was in a hot condition. At that time, the media reported that Trey young was expected to be absent for two weeks, but Trey young recovered quickly, "if you ask our team doctor Chelsea lane, she thinks I have a similar bloodline to Wolverine." In just a week, Trey young can come back. The eagles have a long rest here. Trey young just missed a game.
Are the eagles really lucky? If you really think that's wrong, it seems that God must make trouble for the eagles. The heavy blow to the eagles will come later. League officials suddenly announced that hawks forward John Collins has been banned for 25 games for violating the drug ban, giving the reason that "Collins's growth hormone releasing peptide test results are positive."
Collins became the third player to be banned this season for drug violations, with Wilson Chandler and de Andre Aton in the top two.

The League banned Corinth
John Collins has been suspended for 25 games because his players were not paid during the suspension. According to salary expert Bobby Marcos, the suspension will cost Collins 610582 US dollars. Personal loss is money and reputation, but team loss is combat power. Collins is very important for the eagles. In the first five games of the new season, Collins can contribute 17.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.0 blocks.
Collins's score and rebounds are lower than last season, and his shooting percentage is not as good as last season, but his shooting ability in the new season has improved significantly. As a third year player, if John Collins can open the offensive space, it will enrich the team's playing methods. For John Collins, the personal growth space will also be improved, but only played five games was banned.

Three times of warriors
The team building idea of the eagles is very similar to that of the warriors in their early years. The warriors won the championship by saving Stephen curry, clay Thompson and Drummond green a few years ago. The eagles recruited young talents such as Trevor Kevin hurt and John Collins in the draft. These three young players are also evaluated as close to the warriors configuration. Trey young was called the remake Curie when he started, and helter was praised as having the potential to become the next Tomson. Collins has the same potential.
Before they could fly, the eagles were hit hard, but they were quite similar to the warriors. The warriors are the league's most miserable team at the moment, none of them, several of the main players are all recovering. Compared with the fate of the warriors, the eagles seem to be better. Trey Young's return to the line of fire will give the eagles the greatest help, but the eagles in the absence of Collins is like a lack of wings, it is difficult to fly.
