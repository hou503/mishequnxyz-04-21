When Popovich looks at bertins, will that be so?

Popovich and bertans
The wizards are one of the most disappointing teams in NBA in recent two years. After the beginning of this season, they continue to wander in the middle and lower reaches of the eastern part of the league, and there is a faint hope of rising in the reconstruction. So far this season, they have only won 7-13, but against the 76ers, the wizards are a big surprise. They beat the eastern giants. In this game, three of the Wizards got 20 +, including substitute bertins.
Beltans played extremely well in the second quarter, hitting all seven shots, including five three-point goals, scoring 19 points in a single quarter. The Wizards scored 40 points in the second quarter, which laid the foundation for the wizards to beat the 76ers. "He's the best shooter I've ever seen," he said in an interview after the game, referring to bertans' 7-3 shooting

Beltans hit seven threes
Beltans is an excellent shooter. He has hit 73 three-point goals in 20 games so far this season, with a 45.3% hit rate. Beltans is not a strong player, he only relies on one move to eat in the league, season average 14.2 points to create a career high. Almost all of his scores came from outside the three-point line, and he made a hard shot in the outside line.
It was only by chance that the Wizards got bertins. In order to make room for the signing of Marcus Morris, the Spurs had no choice but to send him away in the three-way deal. However, what makes the Spurs angry is that after they make room for salary, Marcus Morris will not join the Spurs. In this way, the Spurs have lost a good role player in vain, which makes Popovich very angry.

Beltans is trusted
Popovich is fond of bertans. The Spurs always prefer the players who are steady and strong in execution. Bertans from Latvia is such a player. He is very consistent with the requirements of the Spurs, on the field, to work hard to do what Popovich needs him to do. Popovich once told the media that beltans reassured him, "I never need to remind beltans to shoot."
Beltans was selected in 2011, but only landed in the NBA five years later, so he was an "old rookie" when he entered the league. Beltans started at a low level, but his adaptability is also very strong, he will give full play to his shooting ability. And he is also growing in the league, Popovich last season is more happy, "he can hold the ball, and can assist teammates, this is an important signal of his growth."

Marcus Morris's dishonesty
Now it's hard for Popovich to look at bertins, who was traded off-season to the wizards and no longer a Spurs player. Bertans has had more opportunities with the wizards and his performance is better than with the Spurs. Against the old spurs two games, bertans performance is very good, two games were 23 points and 21 points.
Popovich looked at the performance of his beloved, compared to the inner feelings will be more complex emotions, but everything has become a reality irreparable.
