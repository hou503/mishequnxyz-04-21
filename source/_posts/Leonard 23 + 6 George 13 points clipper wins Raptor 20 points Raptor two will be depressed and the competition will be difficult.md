Paul George returned to the banker's life arena and broke out in the boos of fans, leading the team to win two consecutive victories over the old team. The clippers were beaten by the bucks in the first game of their away trip, but the Clippers soon finished their rebound, and the eastern away trip will continue - interestingly, the next game will be against the old team of the Raptors of Cowie Leonard.
Coway Leonard was traded to the Raptors last season, playing only one season for them, but winning the first championship trophy for Toronto in history. "I think there will be some cheers for me, but I think there will be more boos because they want to win," Leonard said of his return to Toronto. They don't cheer for their opponents. "
Despite Leonard's grudges with the Raptors, the clippers and the Raptors have done well this season. Comparatively speaking, the momentum of the Raptors is admirable. In the case of losing two main players in the lineup, and encountering a relatively serious wave of injuries, the Raptors can still play a good record in the East. This will be a strong dialogue between the eastern and Western teams. Which team can laugh to the end?

At the end of the game, the Raptors have no way back, they can only launch all the forces to fight. This time, the Clippers didn't let the first half of the second quarter of the game reappear, and the Clippers who maintained the momentum of attack dominated the game. SICAM is supporting the team on the offensive side, but it is still difficult to change the team's decline. The whole game is over and the Clippers win 112-92. â€‹
The performance of the whole game of the Raptors has been ups and downs, and the score has been constantly reduced under the circumstances of more backwardness. However, the clippers have been playing a wave of attacks and become passive again. In the second half of the game, the Clippers didn't give the Raptors too many chances.
