Celtic opened a five game trip to the west, and suffered a defeat in the Second World War. They lost 99-100 against kings. It's also interesting to say that in the previous game, the kings were definitely killed by James's two free throws, but they found it in the Celtics. Holmes made two fouls and two penalties in the last moment, leaving Celtic team angry at home.
The player who defended the foul was smart, who gave his opponent kings two free throws.
This game is really not good for smart. The last shot basketball rolled on the basket and didn't fall into the circle. Smart said angrily, "it feels like that ball should stay on the basket forever." In the whole game, smart made only 2 hits for 16 shots, 5 points, 5 rebounds and 9 assists. You may be familiar with the "steel plant manager" of the past, but this season's performance of smart is not so much.

Marcus Smart 
As we all know, smart's defensive ability is relatively strong, good at making opponents offensive fouls, but seriously lack of shooting ability. In the first four seasons of his career, smart shot only 36.7% in the best season, which is quite rare among the players in the league who have roughly the same number of shots. In 2017-18 season, except for Allen Jackson, who played only one game, only two people shot more than nine times with a shooting rate of less than 37%.
Who's the other one? Langzo Bauer.
Smart's attack efficiency is too low, but last season it has changed, shooting 42.2%, three-point shooting 36.4% is also a career high. Smart's performance naturally delighted the team, which had offered him a four-year, $52 million contract extension before the season. How about this season? Smart started the season poorly, but has played quite well in recent games.

Green Army four heroes
Since the game against Spurs, smart has been able to hit at least four three-point goals in four consecutive games, with a considerable percentage of hits. If smart can hit the outside shot, it's undoubtedly good news for Celtic team. Stevens's team basketball needs more scoring points in the game. Smart's outstanding hand feeling makes him the "God of the green army soup" to beat the warriors. Smart confidently said, "whenever basketball leaves my fingertips, I feel it will enter."
However, this game, "green army soup God" has revealed its true colors, three-point eight shots only one. However, players will have a downturn, even if the authentic Thompson will also encounter hand cold, the key is that smart's hand can rebound or return to the past. At the end of half-time, smart's hit rate dropped to below 40%, but the three-point hit rate still reached 38.1%.

Marcus Smart 
The role of smart in Celtic team is very important. A week ago, Celtic beat spurs on the road. Jay Brown said after the game, "we rely on Smart's command on the court. In our mind, he is our captain. With him, we can focus on the game itself. I give him more opportunities to get in and out of the box and attract defenders
This is another reason why Celtic value smart. Smart with iron temperament is very suitable for the essence of green army, and his role in the game is hard to be replaced. As a result, smart can hit and shoot at the offensive end to highlight the threat on the court. Although the winning streak was ended, smart didn't think it was a bad thing. "Although we don't want to lose, this loss is a good one. Let's get down to earth again."
In fact, Celtic are still the first team in the East.
