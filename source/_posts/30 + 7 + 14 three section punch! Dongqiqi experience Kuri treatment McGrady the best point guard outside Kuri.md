Luca dongqiqi
**Dongqiqi's new season is getting better and better. He has 7 triple doubles in 15 games, including 31 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists against the Lakers. After scoring such excellent data against idol James, James praised the younger generation "you are really a tough guy". **Dongqiqi's skill is very comprehensive. He is breaking many records of the youngest creators related to the three pairs of data.
In the game against the warriors, dongqiqi cut 35 + 3 pairs of data for the second consecutive game, and also set a record of 35 + 3 pairs with the shortest time. Dongqiqi played only three games against the warriors, and played 25 minutes to reach this data. It's easy to think of Stephen curry after three quarters of playing against the warriors, but today's warriors can only lament.

East chip enjoys the treatment of Stephen curry, and former NBA star McGrady put the two people together. McGrady said in the program: "curry is still recovering and can't play. Kerry Owen has several games off because of injury. Of course, Westbrook is still playing. **But I have to say that Luca dongcici is the best point guard in the league so far this season when Curie can't play. * *
