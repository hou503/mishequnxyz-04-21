The Lakers beat the lone Rangers in the first leg of their trip, but there was a lot of controversy in the game. The referee's report also confirmed that before Danny green scored a three-point draw, Howard della pulled defender Seth Curie, which directly determined the result of the game. However, the result has not been able to change, the Lakers beat the lone rangers to win four consecutive games, and the new season has maintained a good start.
It's not the game itself that excites the Lakers. Kyle Kuzma's comeback adds an offensive point, and the Lakers' running in is getting better. Maybe it can make Vogel's heart more excited about the season. Kuzma hasn't touched the time limit. He only played about 20 minutes against the lone Rangers. However, the changes caused by Kuzma's return have been revealed. Whether he can become the "third giant" remains to be tested.
On the road trip, the Lakers moved to San Antonio to challenge the Spurs, which is not an easy game, but also a competition for the top of the Western Conference. **The Spurs were in excellent form at the start of the season, 4-1 down with the Lakers, coincidentally both teams were beaten only by the Clippers. **Can the Spurs, at home, stop the Lakers from winning in a row?
