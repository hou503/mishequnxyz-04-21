Little Jaron Jackson
After the game started, the Grizzlies immediately gave the Lakers a go. The three-point rain started from the beginning of the game. In the first quarter, the Grizzlies made seven of seven three-point shots in each of the three-point shots -- two three-point shots from little Jarun Jackson and Goodrich, and one three-point shot from Claude, Dillon Brooks and Morant. With a good handle on the outside, the Grizzlies led the Lakers by as much as 10 points in the first quarter.
In the second quarter of the game, the Grizzlies still maintained a good offensive efficiency at the beginning, which allowed the Grizzlies to maintain a double-digit advantage for a period of time. The Lakers' defense gradually improved, reducing the score to only 3 points. But Jay Claude scored eight points in a row, and the Grizzlies expanded their lead. The Lakers narrowed the gap before the end of the first half, but still fell behind the Grizzlies 55-63.

Jarrert
The Grizzlies played very well in the first half of the game. The whole team shot 14-10 three-point shots, and exploded the Lakers' outside defense with excellent results. It's terrifying to have such an outside touch, but it also shows the Grizzlies' attitude towards the Lakers. The more they play against the strong opponents, the harder they play. As a rebuilding team, Grizzlies are not a playoff level team, but they may be a spoiler. Jazz were defeated by Grizzlies a week ago.
Jia Morant once again played a good performance in the game, in the first half of the game 8-for-5 contribution 13 points 6 assists. As the top player of the season, Morant received a lot of attention when he entered the league, and Morant can get 18.5 points and 6.0 assists per game, which does not disgrace his high ranking. After Mike Conley was traded, Morant was trained as the core of the team, and he was also the key to the rise of the Grizzlies.

Morant to James
Interestingly, James' son likes Morant's game very much. After the first game between the Lakers and the Grizzlies, James talked about Morant. "I don't know Morant in private, so I can't judge whether this kid is good or not, but it seems that he is very good and loves the game. In my family, my two children like to watch him play, so he's cool. "
"It's amazing," Morant said before his son liked his game. I remember watching LeBron (James) when I was a kid, and it was interesting to see the news that his son liked my game - you know, it's like, I watched his game before, and I'm looking forward to one day being able to play against him on the court. And now his son pays attention to me, which is cool. "
