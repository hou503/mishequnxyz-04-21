Beverly defending East Church
The clippers, of course, know what the team needs to do with dongqiqi. From the very beginning, they have to put pressure on the young boy to defend and not let him feel his hand in the game, especially the feeling of shooting from outside. Dongqiqi is very good at making amazing performance in the first quarter. This season, dongqiqi scored double points in the first quarter of seven consecutive games. Until the match against the Cavaliers, the first game "only" ended with 9 points.
However, this time, the Clippers will give the super rookie a different treatment. After the game starts, they will use Beverly to defend the East chip. Beverly, who defends fiercely, has been famous in the League for a long time. Although he treats Dongqi's defense gently this time, the defense effect is very good. He hardly gives Dongqi a chance to make an easy shot outside. Forced east to break through the inside line, the basket has a big player guarding, but also to consume East. â€‹

There was a bit of frustration in the East Church game
Dongqiqi didn't find the touch after the opening, his scores were almost all concentrated on the free throw line, the Clippers' strategy was clear, even if the foul didn't let him find the attack rhythm. The clippers have the capital to do this. When Beverly fouls more, Paul George continues to put pressure on Dongqi, and then Leonard is waiting to use the death winding stunt.
The Clippers completely trapped dongqiqi and seized the "snake head" to solve the key problem. "To win away from home, we just need to be focused," Leonard said in an interview after the game. The talent of the opponent is very outstanding. Luca (dongqiqi) has been leading the team forward. What we have to do is to force him to shoot hard shots and give him physical confrontation. I think we did well in the game. "
Leonard's words are true. Dongqiqi made 4 of 14 shots in the whole game (including 8 of 3-pointer, 0 of 8 shots), 14 of 16 free throws, got 22 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists, and made as many as 7 Mistakes in the game.

Paul George scored 26 points
This kind of performance is hard for dongqiqi to be satisfied, and dongqiqi, who is not satisfied with his performance in this game, is resentful. According to NBA reporter Tim McMahon, Dongqi left the stadium without an interview. Dongqiqi, who is eager to win, is very demanding of himself. Last season, he tore his shirt on the court because of his poor performance in the game. Nowadays, in the face of such a defeat, it is inevitable to be in a bad mood.
For a young player, it's not a bad thing to encounter such a test. It's the best kind of training for Dongqi. Paul George also encouraged dongqiqi after the game, "he is just a baby, and his future growth space is very huge. He's really going to know. He's amazing now, so it's going to be scary. When he is fully aware of this, it will become terrifying, and then he will start to really hit his peak. "
After the game, dongqiqi was furious on social media. He wrote a short sentence, "we will rebound!"
Oh, the next game is against the suns.
