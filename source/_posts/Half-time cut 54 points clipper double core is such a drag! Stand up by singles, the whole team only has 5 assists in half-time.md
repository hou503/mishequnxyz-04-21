After the Clippers lost to the bucks in a big score, they won three consecutive games away and occupied the second place in the West. When the Raptors return to the west, the Clippers still have to challenge their opponents away from home, and they are facing the six straight losing Timberwolves. Can Timberwolves stop their decline at home? From the strength point of view, the Clippers are obviously better than the Timberwolves, but the Clippers are many people absent, Beverly and Ludwig are unable to play, which inevitably makes Timberwolves have some ideas.

However, after entering the game, the situation on the field let the Timberwolves slightly disappointed. After Wiggins started to play 2 + 1, the Clippers' double stars Leonard and Paul George kept firing, directly hitting a wave of 16-9 lead. The Timberwolves' defense is worse, and it is more difficult to defend the two superstars of the Clippers. Leonard and Paul George play as easily as they train.
Of course, the same is true of Timberwolves. The attack is mainly focused on Wiggins and Downes. Their attack is also good, and Timberwolves also hold the score tightly. Leonard and Paul George got all 23 points from the start of the Clippers game, and the Clippers didn't have a third until Harrell hit the basket in a row. Leonard hit three-point again, and the Clippers replaced Leonard with a 12 point lead.

Due to the absence of many players, affecting the rotation of the Clippers team, Timberwolves also seize the opportunity to narrow the gap. Andrew Wiggins led the team to play better. He scored three points for Timberwolves in the last attack, with only four points left. By the end of the first quarter, the Clippers had 33 points, Leonard had 16 points and 4 rebounds on 6-for-8, and Paul George had 12 points and 2 rebounds on 4-for-8.
At the beginning of the second quarter, Paul George continued to slash at the offensive end, and the Clippers extended the lead to 10 points. The Timberwolves' defense is like a fishing net with holes. The two big fish of the Clippers freely shuttle during the period and play a happy game. The Timberwolves didn't do well in defense, but they played well in attack. At one time, they were close to or even surpass by attacking.

Corvette Leonard reopened the attack mode. After Leonard scored 7 points in a row, Paul George continued his fire. The Clippers still took the lead. The Clippers led 65-58 at the end of the first half, while the Clippers both scored exaggerated points. Leonard scored 31 points in the half, while Paul George scored 23. The two super giants have scored 54 points together, which is not what the Clippers want to see, but also explains the value of star players.
In addition to the two star players, the other Clippers players got 11 points, Harrell got 9 points, and Patrick Patterson only got 2 points. Of course, it can't be blamed for the poor attack of other players. In addition to Leonard and Paul George, the eight players used in the rotation of the Clippers got a total of 14 mobile phone calls, while Harrell got eight of them, and the Clippers kept the lead completely relying on efficient attack points.
Therefore, the Clippers only had five assists in half time, which is reasonable.
