What's more terrifying is that the Bucks have lost only one of their last 18 games. In the last three games, Bucks have shown their dominance in the East, winning 109 points against three Eastern teams.
Clipper manager Doug rivers was asked before the game whether the bucks are the best team in the East. He said: "I think so. Is there an argument I don't know?" The Clippers are a huge test for both sides. The Bucks need to test the team's quality, while the Clippers need to feel the team's running in during the game.
The Clippers are still in the running in. After Leonard and Paul George combined, the clippers have been exploring a more efficient team match. Although we haven't run into the best condition yet, the attack and defense power of the Clippers has been shown. In the face of the League MVP hot candidate adeto Kunbo, what kind of defense can clippers give their opponents? It's worth noticing.

The clippers have been playing very hard since the start of the game. The Bucks have done a very good defense. It's difficult for the Clippers to find opportunities in the attack. Rivers did not make effective adjustments to the team, and the players fell into singles on the field. The attack ability of "four King Kong" could not be exerted at all. The Bucks, on the other hand, are more exciting and stronger than the Clippers.
