Curie's injury seems to have opened Pandora's box. After him, the injuries of warriors came one after another, especially the core players fell down one after another. Drummond Green's ligament in his left index finger is torn and he will be absent from the team's next games. Diangilo Russell has sprained his right ankle and is unable to play against the Hornets. The new season is full of sorrow, so Cole in an interview broke the rough words, "what's the matter with this * *?"
Just a day ago, Cole was still talking about Russell's shooting options and holding the ball, but what he would not expect is that the team's bad luck will continue. Russell was injured and couldn't play, so the reporter asked Steve Cole, "do you have a backup point guard now?" Cole joked to the reporter, "are you busy now?" The reporter also joked and said: "the salary I asked for is too high, and you have reached the hard salary cap."
For Steve Cole, the team has run out of money.

Perhaps, the plight of the Warriors is not intuitive enough, but to see the team's starting lineup, at a glance.
Against the Hornets, the warriors sent a starting lineup with a total salary of only about 7 million dollars - according to media statistics, guard Kai Bowman's salary this season is 80000 dollars; guard Jordan Poole's salary this season is 1960000 dollars; striker Glenn Robinson III's salary this season is 1880000 dollars; striker Eric Pascal's salary this season is 90 Ten thousand dollars; center Corey Stan is paid $2.18 million this season.
Under the condition that players in the League get hundreds of millions of contracts, the annual salary of players in a single season has exceeded 40 million dollars, while the five starting players of the warriors can only get about 7 million dollars in total. It's like an army with a complete lineup and powerful generals. When the opponent challenges and swears, he is sent to fight against the gang leader. Of course, this is a funny thing, but the warriors can only do so.

Warriors starting lineup
The warriors use three rookies in their starting lineup, Jordan Poole, Kay Bowman and Eric Pascal, while Kay Bowman is a two-way contract player. In a game, three rookies are sent to play, and they are not high potential rookies. If there is no way out, they will do it unless the team is crazy. And neither of the other starters has proven themselves.
It is such a set of lineup, in the game against the opponent Hornets, but played very hard, did not fall in the game. In the first three quarters, the warriors were 3 points ahead of the Hornets, but in the last quarter, they lost to the Hornets 87-93, only 6 points. The Hornets are really weak in the league, but they are much stronger than the warriors, but they still can't easily beat the warriors.

Jordan Poole
Although he lost the game against the Hornets, Steve Cole was very satisfied with the performance of the players. He took responsibility for his loss after the game. Cole said: "* * it was a tough defeat, our players fought hard, and finally the coach messed it up. **I need to take responsibility for this defeat, I am very satisfied with the team's efforts and I am also sorry for the players because I should have done better. "
Cole should show his disciples, they are not shy in the game, they always keep fighting in the game. For these players, they are facing survival problems, so they value the hard won opportunities. They are rookies, two-way contract players and players who are not reused by the team. Only by playing well can they be recognized by the league.
For the warriors, survival is more powerful than shame.
