The Lakers, with flu symptoms, still beat the Nuggets in the top Western Conference, and the team's combat effectiveness is admirable. The Lakers played very actively in the game.

Vogel specifically mentioned rebounding after the game, he said: "our rebounding performance in the past week or two is not good, we mentioned this worrying problem in the pre game meeting. We talked about a lot about Denver, but rebounding is the most important part we need to improve. Our players did it. They only got seven offensive rebounds for the third team in the league, which was great and contributed to the victory
After defeating the Nuggets, the Lakers continue their journey to the northwest, and the Jazz will be the next challenge. The Jazz have been in a bit of a bad shape recently, with the East losing away to the Raptors and the 76ers in a row, in a hurry for a win rally. Despite the Jazz's poor form, but this season in the home record 8-1, this time against the Lakers, can you find confidence in the West boss?

At the beginning of the last game, Kuzma and James each played an attack, and the lead difference was increased to 23 points. The Jazz showed no ambition and desire to win, and the home fans even hissed, which embarrassed the home team. The Jazz team scored 5 points in a row to narrow the difference. Rondo scored 7 points in a row and held the Jazz team down again. The suspense of the game was lost little by little, and the home fans fell into silence.
The more relaxed the Lakers played, Howard even hit the three-point goal, even if the Jazz main force on the court, also failed to close the difference. In the last four minutes of the game, the jazz took the lead in replacing the main players. The backup team of the Lakers is advancing rapidly. Dudley and Daniels each have three-point goals. The attack of the Lakers is very fierce. At the end of the game, the Lakers beat the Jazz 121-96.
The loss to the lone Rangers stimulated the Lakers to a certain extent, and the Lakers played extremely hard in the next two games. Even with the flu and back-to-back fatigue, the Lakers are a much more dynamic team. When the Lakers show their defense completely, their dominance is terrible, and this is the biggest capital of the Lakers since the beginning of the season.
