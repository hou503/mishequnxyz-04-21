In the Lakers' game against the magic, the media only focused on James and Davis, the two superstars who have made a successful combination this season. It's almost forgotten that it's Howard's grudge against the old owners. It's not until the home fans booed us that we realized that Howard has played for the magic for many years. Seven years later, it was the boos of the home fans waiting for Howard.

Howard grabs rebounds
In seven years, Howard has changed many teams, but the magic fans still haven't let go of that hatred. Will Howard have lost many years of memory in his heart when hissing all over the audience? When he left Orlando, Howard was still the top center of the league, but that was the beginning of his career. He came back to Orlando again. He was just a supporting role of the team.
This past year, I have no clue to write, and I have come back half bald.
Howard is still in the habit of doing things in this game, fighting for rebounds, pick and break and simple end under the basket, but there is almost fierce conflict due to him in the game. After he rebounded, he had physical contact with a number of Magic players, but things didn't go in a worse direction. Awandou and Dudley were expelled, calming the conflict.
That's all Howard left in Orlando.

Ridiculed by fans years ago
Howard has been used to all this, from the magic team to the Lakers, every time he left, he became a "coward" in the eyes of fans. Leaving the magic team was questioned, reviled and mocked by magic fans. He didn't get better treatment when he left the Lakers, and Lakers fans booed him. What's more embarrassing for Howard is that he was booed against the Clippers.
As a dominant center player in the league, it's amazing that Howard's career is so difficult. So that the Los Angeles media once defended Howard at that time, "Howard ranked first on the list of critics, and famous stars such as Johnson and O'Neill constantly criticized him. But unless I forget something, in fact, Howard didn't do anything wrong except to drag two underpowered legs to make Kobe and Lakers fans disappointed

Dwight Howard
Obviously, what did Howard realize in the summer that he would rather ask the Lakers to offer him a non guaranteed contract - humble to the dust? Every detail disclosure will only make you feel more humble. Humble is not a derogatory term, but Howard's attitude towards the game, but also his choice of life. Howard has reflected on his career, so he will return to Los Angeles for redemption.
Los Angeles fans have forgotten their unhappiness. They have been conquered by Howard's performance. Howard is no longer a big boy who used to be lax, complaining and depressed. His maturity, sacrifice and forbearance make him look like a prodigal boy who turned back. Has he done enough in Los Angeles? Maybe not enough. Will he return to the starting point of his career to redeem and let those critical fans see his transformation?
Is it more fulfilling to end your career in Orlando?
