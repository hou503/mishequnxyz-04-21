The Hawks' game against the heat, an ordinary regular season game, has a special significance because of one person's participation. Vince Carter - you might call him uncle Carter - reached a milestone in the game, making 1500 career appearances after coming off the bench in the first quarter. The number of appearances ranked fifth in NBA history, with Stockton, Nowitzki, Jabbar and Parrish in front of him.

Vince Carter has played 1500 games, which is a terrible number in the league. Well, as a contrast, James has played 1222 regular season games in his career. James has a very high attendance rate and is now known as the "30 year old", but he has played nearly 300 games less than Vince Carter. Carter can persist to this day, NBA evergreen tree is immortal legend.
And NBA reporter Tim Reynolds wrote on social media, "the eagles currently use nine players. Vince Carter has played 1500 times in his career. No, the other eight players hunt, Parker, Jones, hurt, Trey young, redish, Lynn and Crabbe have played 1370 times." The eagles have a lot of young players in their squad, but Carter has more than eight teammates in total, which is scary enough.

Dialogue between two generations
Carter has been mentioned every season recently, but it's more about his age. Some of his players are a generation younger than him. It's no exaggeration to say that when Carter entered the league, some players have not been born yet. Carter is still happy to compete with such players on the court. The reason why he insists is that he loves basketball more than anything else.
Carter said, "to be honest, I love basketball. If I don't love this career, I don't have the motivation to support myself in training every day. If one day I don't want to prepare for the game or the season, it's time for me to leave - but I'm still willing to do it now. " Carter is just trying to play hard because he doesn't think about joining a championship team.

"Same rookie"
In the 22nd season of his career, Vince Carter was still active on the NBA stage, like an ancient tree stretching out green shoots. At the age of 42, Carter still insists on his love, which is a kind of glory in itself. But for those fans who have followed all the way, they are inexplicably moved, for persistence, dream and love. As a result, many fans watched and cried.
