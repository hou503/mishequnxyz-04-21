The Suns started the season very well, even some amazing feeling, the new season started with 5-3 record. In the last game, they lost to the heat at home, and their opponents ended their three winning streak. Then they will continue to play at home, against the eastern nets. The Nets beat the Blazers in the last game, and the new season's record is 4-4, reaching a winning rate of 50%.
The nets played a tough game last time. Damien Lillard scored 60 points in the game, but the nets still won the game because of the hot offensive performance of Kylie Owen and Ding Weidi, who scored 67 points in total. For the nets, although Kevin Durant is not sure when he will be back, they have to learn how to win the game first. Can they beat the Suns for three consecutive wins?
The Suns played a bit badly against the heat, not being able to defend at all, making the heat easy to score. Losing the game didn't affect the team. Coach Monty Williams said after the team's training: "this is the atmosphere we want to create. Whether we win or lose, it should be like this in the stadium. Nothing can affect the team culture, nothing can affect the atmosphere in the training center
So, who is the winner?
