Three of the four games hit at least 14 three-point goals, but against the Grizzlies, the Lakers shot outside the general feel, the game also played some glue.
The start of 16 games, 14-2, created the personal best of James's career. James said to this, "we played very well and performed well both in home and away. We are satisfied with the status quo, but still not satisfied with our ideal state. It doesn't matter because it's a long season and we want to keep improving, but it's a good start. We are not satisfied, but we are very excited about the process. "
The Lakers then moved on to San Antonio to challenge the recently devastated spurs, who beat the Knicks on the court and just ended their eight straight losing streak. At this time for the Spurs, facing the Lakers is undoubtedly another important node, if we can beat the Lakers, it will greatly improve the team's morale and confidence. If you lose to an opponent, you may go in a completely different direction.
