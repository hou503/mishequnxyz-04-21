James got two free throws at the critical moment, Anthony Davis covered Barnes's last shot, and the Lakers beat the kings hard to stay at the top of the Western Conference. The Lakers' offensive problem is still not good enough, or rely on defense to win the game, so the team still has some room to rise. Against the kings, Pope scored 12 points in the fourth quarter, and it was he who came forward to help the team attack.
When it comes to team defense, James is very proud of it. "Ad (Anthony Davis) can defend both the outside and the inside. He is an all-around defender. He has the ability to keep up with the outside defenders, he can defend the inside players in the low position, he can do anything. I believe that I have also accepted the challenge of being able to defend fast defenders on the outside. If there are big guys who want to play in the low position, I can resist them and let them shoot hard shots. "
James and Davis take the lead to do a good defense, the influence of the team is self-evident, but the problem of attack has to be improved in the game. The game against the eagles, of course, is an opportunity to prove the team's attacking ability. **The Hawks have a poor defensive ability. They were bombed 150 points against the Clippers in the last game. Will the Lakers give the Hawks another punch? * *

James and Kobe
The eagles started the game 3-0 at the end of the game, but James hit the three-point ball because of a foul. The Lakers' offense soon arrived, with Kuzma scoring two three-point goals in a row, returning to a 20 point lead. The eagles are trying to chase points.

James scored two more three-point goals, hit everything, helped Kuzma dunk, led the Lakers to 24 points, the Hawks also called a pause in the game. The Lakers took the lead in replacing most of the main players, led by Kuzma, while the eagles did not replace Trey young.
