After Paul George joined the clippers, he did not play for the team at the beginning of the season due to injury, and Leonard led the team alone. When he came back, it was amazing to play only two games. Paul George's scoring ability was too good - 33 points in 24 minutes against pelicans and 37 points in 20 minutes against eagles.

Such efficient attack efficiency will not be maintained all the time, and then the attack efficiency of the game against thunder team will decline. In the last two home games of five consecutive wins, Paul George only has the shooting efficiency of 4-for-15 and 6-for-20 respectively. The data of the two games is not good. What's more amazing is that in both games, Paul George's shots were mainly from outside, and in two games, he shot 26-9 3-pointer shots.
Paul George's play was obviously intentional.
The clippers have four big players in the attack, Leonard and Paul George, as well as super substitutes Ludwig and Harrell, in order to open up the offensive space, we have to open up the situation in the outside line. Who will take on the task? Harrell doesn't throw three-point shots, Leonard and Wayne are more powerful, so Paul George has become an important scorer on the outside, which is more in line with the attack configuration of the Clippers.

George is ready for the game
Paul George was chosen for the job because he has a good outside shooting percentage, which has been around 40% in the past few seasons. Last season, when playing for the thunder team, they were able to shoot 38.6% of the three-point shooting rate when they averaged nearly 10 shots per game. In the Clippers' tactical system, Paul George's attack point is obviously moving outwards, only the past two games feel bad.
Paul - George's outside touch is not stable, but his shooting is not bad, just need to find their own rhythm. Against the lone Rangers, Paul George broke out after the opening game. In the first game, he made 5 of 9 shots (including 6 of 3 points and 4 of 6 shots), and once made a 3-point shooting foul. In a single game, he scored 17 points. It can't help but say that George's ability to score is still terrifying.

Paul George has a hot hand
For the clippers, Paul George's offensive state is very important, because he is a good offensive player who can play the best role in filling the attack system of the Clippers. In the first quarter of the match against the lone Rangers, Paul George scored 11 points in a row when the match was stuck, establishing a 7-point lead for the Clippers. The Clippers scored 34 points in the first quarter, and Paul George scored 17 points, half of the team's total.
Talent is so outstanding that it's hard to give up. Even if it's treated as a 3D player, it's also the best.
