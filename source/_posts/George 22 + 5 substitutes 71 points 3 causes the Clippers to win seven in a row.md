The Clippers gave dongqiqi a teaching lesson in Dallas. They moved to Memphis with 6 consecutive victories and continued their away journey. After the combination of Paul George and Leonard, Doug rivers is still allocating the players' playing time, but the Clippers' defensive ability is enough to be astonishing. Dongqiqi became the first pilot. He was depressed by the Clippers' defense.
Doug rivers proudly said after the game: "my players are unbelievable, they are very active, everyone can defend * *, Patrick (Beverly), Cowie (Leonard), Paul George, gemael (green), monterez (Harley) and Rodney McGraw, we have many players willing to do well in defense. You can also see that the whole team is doing well, including the basket of iveza zubates, and everyone is focused on the defensive end. "
The Clippers' defensive intensity is really frustrating, and the next one to experience it is the Grizzlies. But it's hard for the Grizzlies to get the Clippers excited. The Grizzlies have just won a series of four consecutive defeats, and Jared Morant has also suffered injuries. Morant finally played, and the Clippers player Leonard was once again on a sabbatical, led by Paul George.

The clippers and Grizzlies are playing very well in this game. What's the reason? First of all, the strength of the Clippers' defense is not enough, the back-to-back game is against the weak brigade, and the preparation of the clippers is not enough; second, the Clippers' internal line suffered losses, and volanchunas stirred the Clippers' internal line to the ground, forcing out a major defect of the Clippers; third, the Clippers' entry point did not open, Paul George and Dewey's attacks are lack of vitality.
