The 20-year-old Luca dongqiqi was depressed when he lost to the Clippers. He was consumed by the opponent's defense in turn, and he could not find the familiar rhythm of the game. After Beverly bit him for a while, Paul George confronted him, and Leonard stood in front of him, too. No one could resist such a high-quality defense. The defensive quality of these three players can be rated as the top in the league. It's not surprising that Dongqi is restricted.

No interview after the match
The performance in the game was not good, and dongqiqi was quite depressed and depressed. After the game, he left the stadium directly without being interviewed by the media. Although Dongqi is young, he started his career very early, and his great desire for victory is rare among young players. In NBA, Wei Shao often has a strong desire to win when playing for thunder team. He will sit on the sidelines of the arena when the team loses, like a volcano reaching the critical value.
The same is true of dongqiqi, who is eager to win.
Last season was dongqiqi's rookie season. After playing several games, he said that his challenge was not from the game, but from the team's winning rate. "It's frustrating to lose because I've always been in a winning team before," said doncic. So when we lose a game, I feel like I'm crazy, that's the difference. "

Dongqiqi is eager to win
The lineup strength of the lone Rangers this season has been improved to a certain extent compared with last season. The team's performance can explain the problem, but there is still a certain gap between the lone Rangers and the top teams. The game against clippers was undoubtedly taught by the opponent. The lineup of lone Rangers has fatal defects. The flaw is that the team relies too much on East Hickey. Once East Hickey is restricted by his opponents, the situation will become critical.
In order to deal with this problem, the lone ranger team sent veteran Barea in the third quarter of the game, and in a period of time, he became a lone ranger. However, the embarrassment is also here. Barea is not a conventional weapon for the lone Rangers. There is no way to send him on. Dongqi is the engine of the team, but a team with only one engine will obviously encounter problems, which is the biggest problem of the lone Rangers.

Andre Iguodala 
Don't the lone Rangers know what the problem is? Of course, they are more aware of their own shortcomings, and they have done some reinforcement during the off-season. However, Delong Wright, Seth curry and others, although they have their own strengths, are not good at being the organizers of the team. What's more, the lone Rangers have considered trading igodara from the Grizzlies, offering Courtney Lee and a future round.
Recently, the deal was mentioned again. Sports Illustrated reporter Mike Fisher reported that the Grizzlies' current response is that they are not willing to take over Courtney Lee's contract.
Igodara was traded to the Grizzlies by the warriors during the off-season, and soon won the favor of many teams, but each team is waiting for the Grizzlies to buy it. Grizzlies don't want to be cheap. They don't buy igodara. They only accept a certain return. The lone rangers are interested in making the deal, but the bargaining chip they offer is hard to please the Grizzlies.

Mark Cuban 
Igodara seems to be a good fit for the lone Rangers. He can organize and play without the ball. He is also a good defensive player. His experience will be very helpful for the young Dongqi. However, the lone Rangers didn't want to put forward more bargaining chips, because igodara's contract is only the last year - even if the deal is completed, the lone Rangers can't be promoted to the championship team quickly, "one year's use right" doesn't mean much to the lone Rangers.
