Barnes scored 30 points
The Denver Nuggets lost away because of a problem in the team's attack. In the first half, Gary Harris gave them the lead. However, in the second half of the game, the overall decline of attack efficiency led to the swallowing of the leading edge, and thus the event of overtime was defeated. The Nuggets' two core players, Jamal Murray and Nikolai Jokic, didn't perform well enough. The former scored 15 points from 6-for-16, while the latter only scored 7 points from 3-for-11.
Jokic has failed to reach double-digit scores in three consecutive games. In the previous two games against the suns and wizards, he only got 8 points. Although the nuggets can score a lot of players, the depth of rotation is the league in the forefront, but the desire for attack is not strong, it is a great harm to the team. After the start of this season, the average score of Jokic is much lower than that of last season. The average score of last season is 20.1 points, and the average score of this season is only 15.6 points.

Lack of desire to attack
As the most talented big player in the league, Jokic's super talent is visible to the naked eye, and he became one of the MVP candidates last season. But laziness is a source of doubt for Jorge. If he is serious and dominating, he will hurt the team if he is too relaxed. Take the MVP to the left, take the lazy fat man to the right, and joachic is very difficult for the Nuggets this season.
This season's performance is not as good as last season's, partly due to the addition of Jeremy grant, the team's rotation lineup is stronger, and he enjoys creating opportunities for his teammates. Coach Mike Malone and his teammates are all trying to protect Jokic, but his performance on the court is obvious to all, he is not positive enough, which is the key to the Nuggets' new season without much improvement.

Nuggets coach Mike Malone
Jokic doesn't work hard in the game, but his ability is beyond doubt. In the game against the 76ers and Timberwolves, in the game against the league's hottest center, Jokic all won the game in a semi-final way. But sometimes it's too lazy, just like the game against kings, and Jorge has no way to help coach Mike Malone.
Fortunately, the Nuggets have a good record in the new season, which doesn't make Joshi feel too much saliva.
