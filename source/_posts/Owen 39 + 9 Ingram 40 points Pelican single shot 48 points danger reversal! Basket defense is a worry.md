The nets lost to the pistons in the last game. After the start of the new season, they were 2-4. The team's record was a bit bad.
During the off-season, the team is very active in the player market. Kevin Durant, Kyrie Owen, and de Andre Jordan joined the team together, which makes the basket tennis team very successful. Although Kevin Durant may lose money in the season, Kerry Owen has been famous in the League for a long time. Under his leadership, the nets are still under the spotlight. The reality is disappointing, at least at the beginning of the season.
It's never a good thing for a team to expect too much, like the nets, because the situation is not as expected to be questioned by the outside world. The negative news about Kyrie Owen is so rampant that it's no different when Kyrie Owen played for Celtic last season. The nets can only rely on victory to dispel the gloom. Victory has always been a good medicine in the league, and the pelican game may be the best chance.
The nets regular season opponents Pelican off-season changes a lot, but Pelican team is not a famous player to join, more or eager to prove their young players. In addition to the Lakers' three less teams joining, the pelicans returned to the draft conference with full load. Unfortunately, the champion Williamson was injured. The pelicans have not been able to send their best team in the new season. The pelicans have a poor record in the new season, only 1-5.

Jules Holliday
Temple hit a three-point goal, and the nets had a good start in the last game, but JJ Redick's fire was more fierce, scoring two three-point goals in a row. After a quiet period of time, leffer's three-point goal and the nets led by eight points. However, such a lead in the offensive war has no advantage. In Frank Jackson's three-point three, the difference was forced to close to five points. The game entered a critical period, the two sides launched a final showdown.
Josh Hart got two points to help the pelicans catch the difference to two points, jarette Allen and Kerry Owen each contributed two points, which curbed the pelicans' momentum of chasing points.
