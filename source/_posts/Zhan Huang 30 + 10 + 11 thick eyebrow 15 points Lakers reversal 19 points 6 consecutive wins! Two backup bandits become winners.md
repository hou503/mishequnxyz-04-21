The Lakers beat the Spurs. After losing the opening game, they won a series of five consecutive victories. The haze at the beginning was cleared. With Kyle Kuzma back on the court, coach Vogel has more available players, but how to deploy the squad has become a new problem. As Vogel said before the season, "happiness worries", the next stage is to help Kuzma find the right position is the most important thing.
Kuzma still has time limit, but his playing time is constantly improving.
For the Lakers, everything is moving in a good direction. Kuzma is back from injury, Howard has successfully integrated into the team, and the team has won five consecutive records. But it didn't satisfy James, who said of the team's five consecutive wins: "for me, I've had so many successes in the league, but I'm still not complacent, and I'm not satisfied."
The Lakers went on the regular season to Chicago to challenge the bulls, but Anthony Davis's comments before the game sparked heated debate. As a native of Chicago, Davis was misunderstood by the media when he was asked if he wanted to play for his hometown team. However, according to follow-up reports from NBA reporter Dave mcmeanin, Anthony Davis said he never said he would consider joining the bulls in the summer of 2020.
Of course, it's just a little storm.

The Lakers finally found the feeling of the game in the last quarter. The whole team played a multi blossom situation.

The bulls can't catch up and just give up. In the end, the Lakers beat the bulls 118-112 to win six straight games in the new season.

James, who can win this game and get three pairs of data in three consecutive games, is very successful. He is very tough in the most difficult time of the team. In addition, cook provided the outside firepower in the game, and Kuzma also had a good performance at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
