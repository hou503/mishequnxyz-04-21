The Lakers beat the bulls on the road. After losing to the Clippers in the opening game, they won a series of six consecutive victories. However, the game was a bit breathtaking and dangerous. The Lakers were 19 points ahead in the first three quarters, 13 points behind at the end of the three quarters, and beat the bulls 38-19 in the fourth quarter.
LeBron James, who was able to beat the bulls and cut down three pairs of data, made great contributions. When there was a problem in the Lakers' attack, James was supporting the team not to fall to the bottom. James laid the foundation for the Lakers' reversal. James got 30 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in this game. He got three pairs of data in three games against lone Rangers, spurs and bulls.

Zhan Huang forwards the poster
After the game, the Lakers officially released a poster to congratulate James, the last Lakers player to get three pairs of data in three consecutive games. It goes back 32 years to Johnson, the "magician". James also became the oldest player to get three pairs of data in three consecutive games in NBA history. **The latter sentence is very impressive. James used to be called "the youngest" when he created data, but now he has to add the word "the oldest". * *
When James forwarded the poster, he added the label "the king who has been angry" and "the king who has been angry" quickly became the block of the team's dressing room.
Davis and James played a joke in the locker room after the game, according to NBA reporter Dave mcmeanin. Davis joked to James, "the king of the past." James replied, "I'm too angry. I'm too angry." Then Davis imitated James in a false voice and said, "I'm LeBron James. I can't do anything more than win three pairs."

James and bushbrow
Davis and James joke, can see the relaxed atmosphere of the Lakers locker room, especially the relationship between the star players is very harmonious.
Since Anthony Davis was traded to the Lakers, LeBron James has done a lot for the younger brother, hoping that Anthony Davis can feel comfortable in the team. Although the act of giving Davis the No. 23 Jersey on his back was denied, James' attitude made Davis feel useful, and James took the initiative to step back and Anthony Davis was the main attack point of the team.
James's rapport with his teammates can be seen everywhere, not only to Davis, but also to encourage his teammates more than to complain. He praised his teammates more than to scold them. James was very happy for Kuzma to find the rhythm in the second half, and for the players to find the game state. He often praised Howard, the former opponent's current teammate, and the team became relaxed.

Anthony Davis 
On the other hand, we can also see the sincere admiration of teammates for James' ability. James can easily do many things. Maybe you can hear from Lakers coach Vogel, "he's a player of another level, I don't know what else to say. He is a dominant player in the league, very comprehensive. It's special to be able to make a contribution on the defensive side, but at the same time take more responsibility on the offensive side. "
James knows what he needs. He has experienced countless storms in the league. As an old general, he has seen through the prosperous vicissitudes of the world. He is also more aware of his physical condition. The once mighty domineering demeanor has turned into the indifference on the court, and James can play freely in the game. At his age, he set the best example for the younger generation and get along with his teammates more peacefully.
**The best age is over? The best age seems to be still! * *
