The Clippers played jazz at home, but after the start of the game they encountered a cold hand, and even the robot like Cowie Leonard could not find the shooting feeling. In the first half of the match, the Clippers got only 39 points. How could it be like a strong clippers after the start of the season? Although the Jazz are good at defense, it's surprising that their score is so poor.
Of course, it's not entirely because of the excellent defense of the Jazz team. The problem of the clippers is mainly due to their own attack, the chance to miss, and the whole team is infecting each other. It was only in the second half that the situation gradually improved. From 39 points in the first half to 40 points in the fourth quarter, the attack of the Clippers was a little too ups and downs. It was the fourth quarter that the Clippers won.

Mitchell cut 36 points
The clippers can win the game, and the excellent performance of Cowie Leonard in the fourth quarter is naturally very important. In addition, the stable performance of Monterey Harrell is also indispensable. Harrell is undoubtedly the most efficient player in the Clippers team, with 7 of 10 shots and 19 points and 8 rebounds. **Although Coway Leonard is known as the "robot" for his stability, Harrell seems to be more stable, like the violent version of Leonard. * *
As we all know, Harrell's attack means are relatively single, and he does not have the ability to open the space, so he is greatly questioned. But one move is delicious, Harrell's ability to finish under the basket is the best, and the second attack is his best. He has played seven games so far in the season, averaging 19.3 points, 5.9 rebounds per game, and his shooting percentage is 73.6%.
——Of the players who have played more than 20 minutes this season, Harrell's shooting rate is only lower than Dwight Howard's.

In the first half of the game against the jazz, because the whole team was not in attacking state, Harrell did not get too many attacking opportunities. When the team can also hit and shoot from the outside, the Jazz dare not shrink to the basket any more, and Harrell's chance finally comes. In the second half of the game, Harrell scored 15 points in 19 minutes and grabbed 8 rebounds in the second half.
In the fourth quarter of the game, Harrell kept fighting for the ball to make it into the basket. Ballmer, the owner of the game, was excited and crazy like a child. It's not the first time Ballmer has been excited by Harrell's performance. Harrell often shows beast like physical fitness in the game. His tough playing style is very enjoyable. When the team is in silence, Harrell can often ignite the passion of the team.
Harrell's performance is very hot, even let the Fauvism player Drummond green admire. Last season, the Clippers faced the warriors. Green was interviewed by a female reporter after the game. When he saw Harrell, he interrupted the interview to hug him in the distance. The so-called tough guy who can be recognized by the tough guy is undoubtedly the real tough guy.

Boatman Ballmer
Such an efficient player gets a very low salary.
In the summer of 2018, Harrell, who averaged 11.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in the previous season, renewed his contract with the clippers, which was a $12 million two-year contract extension. The $6 million annual contract is worth a lot of money, and Harrell has grown into one of the league's most efficient sixth men. However, the contract will expire in the summer of 2020, when the Clippers want to stay Harrell, I'm afraid it will cost the Clippers.
Despite his excellent performance, Harrell has never let up. He said again after the game that the key to his success is, "I have to work harder than everyone, and this is how I came to the league. Try my best on the field, I will continue to be myself and move on. I will continue to improve my performance, play hard, play energetically and do my best for the team. I will continue to improve these aspects. "
**In Harrell's eyes, what he has to do is always very simple - try his best. * *
