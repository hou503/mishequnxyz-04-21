The Lakers' away game against the pelicans was very fierce. The pelicans were in a strong position at home and kept leading most of the time. At the final moment of the fourth quarter, the gap between the pelicans and the Lakers appeared. The key ball ability of the Lakers was significantly better than that of the pelicans. Finally, the Lakers narrowly beat the pelicans 104-100. The Lakers, 16-2 in the new season, still maintain the best record in the league.

Davis and Holliday
Anthony Davis, who returns to the king of iceberg center, is undoubtedly the main character of the game. Before the old pelicans, Davis had a lot of strength in the Lakers' away game against the Grizzlies. He put all his energy into the game against the pelicans. Davis maintained a strong aggressive, the game 30 shots 15, contributed 41 points and 9 rebounds, in addition to the data, but also rely on key steals for the Lakers to kill the game.
Davis received a lot of praise after the game, Lakers coach Vogel said of his performance: "he (Davis) performance is very good, unbelievable. The pelicans' home atmosphere is not easy for him, the hiss of local fans, and his former teammates and coaches who are familiar with him, but he put it all aside, focused on the field, and made a good performance. "
It's normal for Davis to be praised for his excellent performance at both ends of the attack and defense, but there's also an unimportant Lakers player who was praised after the game - Alex Caruso with only 2 points and 1 rebounds and 2 assists. "He's a good player on both sides of the attack and defense, he's a good defender on the outside and he's a model who can influence the game without scoring," Vogel said of Caruso

Vogel praises Caruso
Of course, it's wrong to think that Vogel only encourages Caruso politely. Although the role of Caruso is not reflected in the data, the manager and his teammates feel it. In fact, not only did Vogel praise him, James also said, "he has brought us everything, he has brought us stable control, excellent defense, basketball intelligence and tough attitude, we need all of him."
Is Caruso really as good as the Lakers general says? It can be seen from Vogel's use of kaluso that kaluso played a total of 13 minutes in the first three quarters, while in the fourth quarter, he played the whole game. In the fourth quarter, Caruso was on the court all the time, and Vogel didn't give Rajan Rondo time in the last quarter, just because Caruso had to defend better.
The data is not completely unresponsive. Kaluso's positive and negative value is + 23, the player with the highest positive and negative value in the whole team. The pelicans were able to take the initiative at the beginning of the game, because the first quarter of the game on 9-11 three-point pitch, the Lakers do a really bad defense outside. However, in the next three quarters, pelican's outside shooting rate has been constantly pulled down, and Caruso's defense has a very important contribution.

Alex Caruso
Caruso was ridiculed as "bald Mamba" by fans. In the past two seasons, he only got a two-way contract from the Lakers. Last season, he averaged 9.2 points, 2.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists, which attracted the attention of the league. "Open air stand" reporter Leo Sepkowitz once revealed in the article that when the 2019 off-season, there were as many as 12 teams interested in Caruso, including the warriors.
In the end, Caruso chose to stay with the Lakers for a two-year, $5.5 million contract.
Although the Lakers have no lack of defenders in this season's lineup, Caruso, who has excellent defense and is able to serve as a ball controller, can still be trusted by Vogel. In addition to Costas adetokumbo, who only played for the team for two minutes in total, Caruso is the most efficient player in defense of the Lakers, even surpassing Bradley, Howard and other famous defenders.
The Lakers' signing of Caruso is absolutely worth it, and that's why he's getting attention in the player market.
