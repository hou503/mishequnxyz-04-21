The Lakers' game against the jazz, the away game of the Lakers played very dominant, easily beat the home game of the jazz. The Lakers dominated the Jazz almost the whole game. The opponents were sleepy on the court. The home fans even hissed at the home team. The hardness of Salt Lake City is impressive. The quality of perseverance, hardness and iron blood are all the labels of Salt Lake City, but this war has disappeared.
Donovan Mitchell said of the game: "we made mistakes and when you make a lot of mistakes, it's hard to keep execution on the defensive side. When you make a mistake, you have to defend immediately. You need to defend your opponent's pitchers, guys like Anthony Davis and LeBron (James), who have a lot of weapons

The game was easy, James was excited, and he reached a milestone in the game. The game against the Jazz team scored 20 points, James' total career score reached 33101 points, plus a total of 6911 points in the playoffs, with a total career score of 40012 points - officially over the 40000 mark. James is still at a high level and his legend continues.
Despite his absence from the playoffs last season, James' total playoff scores remain the number one in history. In the 2016-17 playoffs, James scored 29 points in less than three quarters in the fifth game of the Cavaliers' Eastern finals against Celtic, thus surpassing Michael Jordan, the historical scoring champion of the playoffs. Since then, James has continued to expand his lead in the postseason history scoreboard, currently scoring nearly 1000 points higher than Michael Jordan's total.
It's worth mentioning that there are only two active players in the top 20 of the postseason scoring list, and the other is Kevin Durant, who is in 10th place.

James surpasses Jordan
James ranks first in the postseason scoring table, but the regular season is not his world. At present, James ranks fourth in the regular season scoring. James scored 33101 points in the regular season, behind Karim Jabbar, Karl, Malone and Kobe Bryant. A week ago, James just got 33000 points and became the youngest player in NBA history.
Fans will have a question: can James surpass Jabbar in the total score of regular season? James is 5286 points away from Jabbar at the top of the table. James has played 16 seasons before, and gets 2034 points on average every season. If he plays this way, he will surpass Jabbar at the top of the table in another three seasons. There are two questions to consider, of course, James' age and his willingness to score.

James and son
James will be 35 by the end of the year, and his energy will not be all on scoring, James said at the beginning of the season, the team's first offensive position to Anthony Davis. James' average score is declining this season, but he can also contribute 25.4 points per game, while his average 10.8 assists is a career high, James still maintains a good scoring ability in the process of role change.
In fact, James is likely to be the top scorer in history. First of all, James's health is well maintained. This season, he often performs dunking, and his physical condition can support him to play for several years. Second, James may "meet" with his son in the NBA. James's son is expected to participate in the draft in 2023, which means that James will play several more seasons.
The legend of James is far from over.
