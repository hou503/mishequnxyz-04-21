After two bitter battles in Los Angeles, the thunder team will return home with two defeats in a row, and will have another game with the Lakers. For the thunder team, it is not only an opportunity for revenge, but also a tough challenge. The thunder team's performance in the new season is not satisfactory, not because the two superstars left and completely reduced to the fish belly team, but also did not play too amazing game in the league.
What about the Lakers? After beating the thunder in the last game, the Lakers got a wave of five wins in a row, and the team's current record is the best in the league. The Lakers can have such an impressive record, and the team's defense is inseparable, but it is gratifying that the Lakers in the past two games outside shooting good. In the game against the eagles, the three-point goal was 35 to 15, while in the game against the thunder, the three-point goal was 31 to 14.
Does such a good feel mean that the Lakers' offense is improving? When coach Vogel talked about the team, he said: "there are many teams that want to play wild western style. The first choice to receive the ball is to shoot, whether there is a defender or not. We want to play smarter than that, we want to build a culture on the pitch, believe in passing and fight for each other
Against the thunder again, can the away Lakers continue to win?
