When Guo Degang participated in an entertainment program, he said that "* *" before the age of 30, you are not crazy, but after the age of 30, you must not be crazy "* *. It's not unreasonable to think carefully. Life before 30 can be imagined infinitely, and struggling for it. But after 30, if struggling for it, it's not very mature, and it's hard to do anything.
When I think about this, I always think of Cameron Anthony. When I was young, the joy of riding my horse and galloping my life, permeated from his sunny smile, was easy to infect everything around me. However, when the sunshine boy's face gradually became frosty, his sad face climbed onto the smile to show his crafty pride, Anthony's life was full of sadness, sorrow and years of violence.
**Life's thirty years old, how wonderful, shaped like a watershed to determine fate. * *

Anthony and Iverson
Basketball player's career is not long. It's hard to play ten seasons in NBA, so players' 30-year-old will come earlier. The players in the league, after entering the league, can basically determine the future after playing two or three seasons. Although there are big underachievers, they are few and few. The fierce competition in the League intensifies the elimination speed of players, which may not be needed by the League after a season.
Applying Guo Degang's words, players can be frivolous when they are young, but they will reach a high level in a few years.
Luca dongqiqi entered the League last season, and his great talent and maturity were impressive in the rookie season, with rookies averaging 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 6.0 assists. **Dongqiqi is praised as James's successor. It's normal for him to be young and frivolous. Last season, he said, "we've lost as many games as I've lost in my previous life.". * *
Dong Qiqi, who is used to the professional league early, is hard to accept the result of failure, which is not a bad thing, and it is easier to become a driving force to move forward. Dongqi's ability to adapt to the game is unparalleled. People who have seen Dongqi's game will say most of the time, "he seems to be a veteran who has played in the League for many years.". His choice of attack, passing skills or rhythm control are very much the style of the general in the league.
However, the Luca Dongqi wizard is only 20 years old.

Heritage of European descent
Sometimes, fate will play a joke, or good or bad.
**When Dirk Nowitzki's war spirit subsided, the sad atmosphere in the league could not be around, fate will leave to the arena, but also to the battlefield of life. Dirk Nowitzki represents the youth of a generation, and the story of youth does not exit only exists in the story. Dirk Nowitzki hobbles down from the arena, and the youth of a generation can not disguise their hesitation and flee. * *
However, when Luca dongqiqi came, another story about youth began slowly, but it had nothing to do with you and my youth. In the dark, fate is just a joke. The separation of Dirk Nowitzki and the coming of Luca Dongqi, whether malicious or good, depends on the mood. **Of course, it has nothing to do with Luca dongqiqi. He is just a handsome young man with a dream, running towards his dream. * *
When Nowitzki talked about the little brother in Europe, he was full of expectation for his future. "He (dongqiqi) is omnipotent. He has medium distance shooting, dry pull-out shooting and backward step shooting. He has excellent control of the ball. He can run the pick and roll tactics. He will be very suitable for the league. Because the trend of the league is to pick and roll, I think he will be very good in the league

New favorite of lone Rangers
**At the end of rookie season, dongqiqi is full of disappointment, but the lone Rangers see hope. * *
The lone Rangers got help for East Hickey last season. Polzingis was traded from the Knicks. He didn't play last season because of injuries. During the off-season, the lone Rangers provided bolzingis with a contract extension, which locked in the team's future core combination. The two young players have played well in the new season, and the lone Rangers have become a playoff team, and the playoffs will be one of the season's goals of the lone Rangers.
Dongqiqi is in a better condition in the new season. He has played his front skills incisively and vividly on the field. He can get almost three pairs of data per game. **The craziest game, the lone Rangers vs. the Lakers, James and dongqiqi play three pairs of big numbers at the same time - dongqiqi plays 38 minutes, gets 31 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists; James plays 42 minutes, cuts 39 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists. * *
At the end of the game, Dongqi hugged his idol James. James said to Dongqi, "you're such a tough guy!" A year ago, when Dongqi was a rookie, there was still a big gap between him and James. The only impression of dongqiqi in the two matches of the season is that he blocked James twice, but now he can be regarded as a real opponent by James.

James and dongqiqi
From a handsome boy to a tough guy, it's just a multi season time.
Dongqiqi's performance is good enough, but if we look at dongqiqi with a higher standard, dongqiqi still has some defects. First of all, Dongqi is prone to be emotional in the game, which will affect the rationality of his handling of the ball. Dongqiqi was more emotional last season, even tearing his shirt when he was not performing well. This season has been greatly improved, but he will still be affected by the mood.
Secondly, dongqiqi's technique still needs to be improved, and his attack efficiency is not high enough. Compared with LeBron James, the end of the basket of East chip is still lacking, but East chip's long-range shooting technology is better than James. Dongqiqi's outside shooting is not good enough. This season's three-point shooting rate is only 32.8%, which is what dongqiqi can improve.
In terms of performance at the same age, dongqiqi is good enough, but if you want to grow into a superstar, dongqiqi has a long way to go.
