The NBA has a saying that "it's not terrible to win, but it's embarrassing to lose.". This is more of a joke, which means that when a team always doesn't win, when a player wins when he is absent, the person who is absent will be very embarrassed. However, sometimes it can be said, "it's not terrible to lose, who is more embarrassed?" for example, raptors vs. heat's Kyle lorry.
Kyle lorry has been injured in eight games this season and has been absent for nearly a month until his return against the heat. The time of recuperation is quite boring and boring. Coach Nick NASS has said before that Lori has been taking on some work of teaching assistant. Lori joked: "I'm a little tired of teaching assistants. I just want to play. NASS said I'm a bit professional as a TA. I think he's joking. This should be what the media do. "

Lori talks to the referee
Before Kyle Lowry's truce, the Raptors won 6-2, and the defending champion's performance was impressive. When Lori was absent, the performance of the Raptors was not affected. Even Ibaka was absent during this period. The Raptors won 9-2 in 11 games. During this period, the Raptors defeated many teams including the Lakers and the 76ers, only losing to the clippers and the lone Rangers.
It's hard to imagine that the defending champions, the Raptors, would be so competitive when Danny green and Leonard left. In many games, under the leadership of cicham, van fleet and Pau Gasol, the Raptors are full of role players. These role players, including the second round show, players eager for opportunities, two-way contract players and so on, all need to fight for themselves.

Kyle lorry is back on the pitch, obviously he still needs to adapt to the intensity of the game, and the process of the game has disrupted the team's pre match deployment. Before the game, NASS said that Lori's playing time in this game is unlimited, and the goal is to let Lori play 33 minutes. However, the game entered the extra time, Lori finally played 41 minutes, the whole game only 2 for 18 shots, 3-pointer is 11 for 0, contributing 12 points, 6 rebounds and 11 assists.
Asked about the shooting problem in 18-for-2 shooting in this game after the game, Lori was more optimistic, he said: "it's too bad, but it's just the rhythm problem, man, I lost a lot of shots, I didn't force myself to shoot, I don't think I haven't played since the pelicans game. So it's going to take time and I'm sure I'll play better in the next game and I don't need to worry about it

In the first game after his comeback, Kyle lorry didn't help the team, but to a certain extent, slowed down the team's attack. But as Lori said, his performance before the injury this season was excellent, he just needs time to adjust his condition. It needs to be pointed out that Lori is not fully prepared for his comeback. He feels that his thumb is in good condition after warm-up. He decided to play before the game.
Against the heat is also a tough team, they also rely on the overall play, the two teams play very fierce game. The Raptors were suppressed almost the whole game, until Norman Powell hit a three-point goal, the Raptors scored 1 point in the last minute, and Jimmy Butler equalised the score with two penalties and one hit. Both sides failed to make the final attack. The heat beat the Raptors 13-2 in overtime.
It's a pity to lose the game, but the strong of the Raptors didn't.
