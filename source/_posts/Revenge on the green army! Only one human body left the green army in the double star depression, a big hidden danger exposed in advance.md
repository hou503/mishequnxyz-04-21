The nets went to Boston to challenge the Celtics and ended up winning the game. How tough was the Celtics in the first game? The nets managed to make 21 3-pointers, but failed to escape Boston. The Celtics defended their home court. And then he moved to the Barclays center to fight again, laughing that the last team became the nets, and the Celtics were avenged.

Jay Brown
Celtic home basketball team against the nets game, the team's overall play is better, Jay Brown contributed 22 points and 10 rebounds, Walker is down 39 points. Walker suffered injury recovery very fast, back to the game has a strong performance, the ability to adjust is amazing. But after Jay Brown got the big contract in the off-season, the new season's condition has not small promotion, further fulfills own talent.
However, the away game has become totally different. Walker's hot hand is as cold as water. In the whole game, he made 6 of 19 shots, and only made 1 of 8 three-point shots. Walker hit the key shots repeatedly in the game, which is an important factor for Celtic team to win the game, but the game did not last. Jay Brown was a different man from two days ago. He struggled all the time, only contributing 8 points and 6 rebounds.

Jason Tatum
Celtic's only eye-catching performance is Jason Tatum, 19 of 10, 26 points, 9 rebounds and 4 steals, but there were 6 mistakes. Compared with the game two days ago, Tatum is a strong rebound. In the previous game, Tatum was a bit poor. Celtic is a team that relies on the whole to play. It's hard to beat the opponent with only one player playing well. It's embarrassing that only Tatum is positive and negative for Celtic's five starters.
Of course, this is the last thing Celtic want to see. The whole team is too hesitant on the defensive side and lacks the usual defensive strength, but there is no connection between the offensive side and the whole team has 19 mistakes in 16 assists. Celtic are in a hot state at the beginning of the season, but in recent years, they have ups and downs. In addition to the influence of injury factors, the lack of super stars can stabilize the situation, which is still the hidden danger of Celtic.

Kemba Walker 
Two games between the nets and Celtics, each winning the next game at home. Compared with the game itself, Kerry Owen is the topic that is talked about more. Can we disappear after two games? After the game, Walker said, "now it's time to finish. It's time to finish.". I'm in Boston now, and he's in Brooklyn. Let's go. "
It's time to go.
