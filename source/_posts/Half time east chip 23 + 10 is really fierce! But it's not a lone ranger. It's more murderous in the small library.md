NBA regular season in Mexico City for a game, against the two teams are the lone Rangers and the pistons, the lone Rangers this season is very good, and the pistons are in good shape recently. When the lone Rangers came to play against the kings, dongqiqi once helped the team desperately to catch up with the points at the last moment, but in the end, they failed to complete the reversal before the end of the game.
At the end of the match, dongqiqi was asked many questions about the referee after the match, but dongqiqi did not express dissatisfaction with the blow. "I know what to do and I have to be patient because it doesn't work a lot of times," he told the media very calmly. Sometimes I have to calm down and be ready for the next game
This young and mature boy will be emotional because of the game, but he will soon come out of the mood.

Luca dongqiqi
Against the pistons, dongqiqi was not in good condition and failed to score in successive attempts to attack. At the beginning of the game, the pistons played a score of 9-2, and dongqiqi's state became an important reason why the lone Rangers fell into passivity. The lone Rangers came back to the game after a pause. Dongqiqi was more determined in attacking. He made three defensive fouls for his opponents in a row, but the free throw performance was too bad. Four of the six free throws were lost.
However, relying on the free throw makes the hand feel warmer. With 7:38 left in the first game, dongqiqi hit the first three-point goal of the game, and then got two points to recover his offensive influence after breaking through the layup. Dongqiqi also sent out a wonderful assist in the game. The back pass created an opportunity for Dwight Powell to attack defenceless. Powell easily completed a dunk under the basket.

Dwight Powell 
With more than four minutes left in the first quarter of the game, Dongqi made another three-point shot, and then made an outside shot foul - wood was cheated by Dongqi's shot even though his hands were behind his head. At the end of the first quarter, dongqiqi played the whole game, made 4 of 9 shots (5 of 3 points, 2 of 5 shots), got 15 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists.
In the second quarter of the rotation, the lone Rangers' firepower point was transferred to Seth Curie, who continued his excellent state at the end of the first quarter. At the beginning of the second quarter of the game, he played an 8-4 lead to help the lone Rangers expand the difference. Seth Curie's hand feeling has been continuous, becoming the most important offensive support for the lone Rangers in the second quarter of the game. When the pistons attacked fiercely, the lone Rangers were not too passive.

Seth Curie
The first competition is Luca dongqiqi, and the second competition is Seth curi. Each of them plays an efficient single game, and the lone Rangers can keep the lead at the end of the half-time competition. In the first half of the game, dongqiqi got 23 points, 10 rebounds and 3 assists, while Seth Curie made 5-for-7 three-point shots, and contributed 23 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists to the lone Rangers. The two players cut 46 points in the half of the game. Is that enough hot?
