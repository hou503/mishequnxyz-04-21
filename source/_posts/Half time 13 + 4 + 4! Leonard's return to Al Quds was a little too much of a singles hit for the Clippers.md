After Leonard and Paul George got together, the Clippers made great progress. Although there were some bitterness in this, the overall strength of the Clippers has been shown. Compared with the hands, the Clippers are not only strong in the configuration of the two giants, but also in the depth of the lineup. There are two players sitting on the bench - Ludwig and Harrell. They have the ability to change the result of the game. The clippers have a pair of super partners in the first place and a pair of super partners in the second place.
Earlier, after the Clippers beat the lone Rangers, Paul George said: "think about it, our substitute can get more than 50 points, it's very difficult for the opponent to win these. My starting line-up with Leonard, plus more than 50 points on the bench, is to keep scoring and attacking. **We call this a continuous attack wave. We have such an attack wave. * *

Leonard returns to the Holy City
The Clippers went to holy city with the impact of seven consecutive victories. What they were waiting for was a sad soldier who was exhausted physically and mentally. The Spurs had won and lost 1-10 in the past 11 games, just like they were going to fight for the top pick with the warriors. The Spurs' record is really too bad, so in the past period of time, there have been many trade rumors. The Spurs urgently need a victory to boost their morale, while the Clippers are not easy to deal with.
At the beginning of the first quarter, the Spurs played very well at home, especially for the Clippers' main line-up defense, which made the Spurs able to stand up to the Clippers. In the first half of the game, the Spurs were two points behind 11-13. The rotation of the Clippers team is fierce, with Jamie Green's outside shooting and Harrell's work under the basket, helping the Clippers keep the lead all the time.
Trey riles hit a three-point goal. At the end of the first quarter, the Clippers only led the Spurs 30-27.

Leonard was traded to the Raptors
Spurs players look a little different from before. In the second quarter, they hit an 11-0 attack climax, leapfrogged and gained an 8-point lead. The Clippers are not willing to fall behind, in return for a wave of 10-0 offensive flow, the score was dragged into the glued situation. Leonard gradually returned to the offensive state, the Clippers bench as always stable, and the Spurs also played very hard, the Clippers will not be able to open the score.
Confrontation becomes the main theme of the field, both sides continue to get free throws, the rhythm of the game is broken. The attack became a bit more difficult, both sides were supported by stars, Leonard hit a goal and Aldridge responded. In the last three minutes of the first half, it was difficult for both sides to score in the attack. At the end of the first half, the clippers and the Spurs drew 53.

Leonard is on the clipper
Returning to San Antonio is of special significance to Corvette Leonard. Although he left the Raptors to join the Clippers during the off-season, the Spurs still have some complex in Leonard's heart. There was a fight with the Spurs this season, but it was at the Clippers' home court, and this game was at the Spurs' home court. Leonard didn't play calmly in the game, not like the usual Cowie Leonard.
Leonard made a lot of moves in the game, and brought the game into his own singles mode. He was blocked by the Spurs' defenders for many times, which ignited Leonard's inner fire. It wasn't until after the second quarter that Leonard finally found his hand, which had a great impact on the Clippers' attack. In the first half, Leonard got 13 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists from 6 of 17 shots.
Leonard will also have a situation, which is relatively rare.
