The Clippers lost the focus of the war, but also a fiasco, which let the outside world for the Clippers questioned the sound of wind. Known as the "finals preview" of the game, there was a one-sided situation, the game even appeared garbage time, which really made the Clippers feel ashamed. Rivers made fun of himself after the game, calling it the best "birthday present" for brother alphabet.
But it's just a regular season game. The clippers have to move on. The team's journey away is not over. The Clippers will play six games on the road. The big score loss to the Bucks obviously didn't make a good start, but the next game against the Wizards may be easier. After being defeated by bucks, can clippers finish the rebound quickly? This is one of the highlights of the game.
The wizards are still disappointing this season, with a 7-14 record so far, 12th in the East. In the past five games, the Wizards have only won 1-4. The only victory is to beat the 76ers in a cold blow. The Wizards don't have absolute strength and are not stable enough, but they have the ability to explode suddenly. Beltans and eight villages are their secret weapons. Can they make trouble for their opponents against the Clippers?
