The Lakers made two stops in the northwest, winning the Western Conference first and beating the Jazz easily. The only road trip left was against the Blazers. Although lost to the lone Rangers at home in the third defeat of the season, but did not affect the mood of the Lakers players, the Lakers quickly found a winning feeling away. And what's more gratifying is that this Lakers team is full of enthusiasm and everyone is enjoying the happy team atmosphere.
Of course, the two winning Lakers are also breaking the outside world's doubts. The Lakers were once considered too easy in the previous schedule, so they can occupy the top position for a long time. After beating Denver and jazz away, Dudley wrote on social media, "haven't we met any strong teams yet?" Compared with the schedule in November, the Lakers will encounter more powerful opponents in December.
The game against the Blazers is of special significance to James and Anthony, who are quite familiar with each other and know each other very well. Anthony came back to the league, full of life, out of a year of decadent situation, career can continue. James said of Anthony: "his tenacity, he will not let anything block the pace of progress, do not care what others say, is to be himself, believe in his experience, and will not let anyone block him."
What will be the result of another match in their careers?

Rajon Rondo 
At the beginning of the last game, Lillard got 3 points for free throws and Kyle Kuzma scored 3 points directly. It's hard for the Blazers to stop the Lakers from scoring. Lillard made two penalties for a foul, Kuzma even got 4 points, the difference to 20 points again. James scored two more points on the offensive end, CJ McCollam scored three points, Kuzma continued to maintain the efficient attack of the final game, and the Blazers became more and more difficult.
The Blazers were unable to catch up, and the game gradually went into garbage time. At the end of the game, the Lakers beat the Blazers 136-113.
The defense of the Blazers is nothing, the Lakers play very easily in the game, and it's no wonder that they win the game in the end. The Lakers are full of offensive power, with James and Anthony Davis constantly hitting the inside, and 17 of the team's 3-pointer 36 shots on the outside, which is hard for the Blazers to parry. The Lakers played with ease, leading by as much as 21 points in the game, and the Blazers were catching up almost the whole game.
A good offense is one of the reasons the Lakers won.
The second reason is that although the Lakers defense did not show the top level, it still put a lot of pressure on the Blazers, which makes it difficult for the Blazers to fully open their firepower. Lillard's offensive performance was good, while his partner CJ mccollham's offensive downturn, Anthony did not play a prominent performance. Another reason is that the accident on the field has a great impact on the Blazers. The injury and departure of hood and the expulsion of stoz have caused varying degrees of damage to the Blazers.
The Lakers showed great dominance, and the "Jamie and eyebrow" combination explained the value of superstars.
