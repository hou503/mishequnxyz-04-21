The Clippers' problems in running in are gradually exposed. At present, this race schedule is very important.
Leonard said of the team's performance in the two away games: "we watched the video of the game and we knew that we had a very bad game (against the Bucks). We just try to slow ourselves down and play our offense. We just hit the shots. We have to try to play a stable performance, in the face of a competitive team to play such a performance
NBA reporter Chris Heins has previously reported that Leonard's absence against the Pacers was due to a knee injury. In the absence of Leonard, Paul George will play alone, and the game against the Pacers is of special significance to Paul George. Paul George played for many years with the Pacers, but finally broke up with them.
