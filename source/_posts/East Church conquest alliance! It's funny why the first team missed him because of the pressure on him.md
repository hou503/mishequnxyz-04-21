Who is the most influential young player in the NBA? It's Luca dongqiqi.
Last season, dongqiqi and Trey young became the top two rookies of 2018. Their performance made the League marvel. There is no lack of talent and potential in the league, but two young players with story lines are connected, which the league would like to see very much. One season, both of them played well, and then in the following season, they went on a different way.
Trey Young's performance can't be said to have no progress. The data of 25.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game are quite eye-catching, but if it is compared with Dongqi, it will be worse. Dongqiqi's performance in the new season can only be described as "Crazy". A number of records are written in his hands, with an average contribution of 30.6 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.8 assists. How amazing is it?

Luca dongqiqi
What's more important is the team's record. Under the leadership of the second grade player, the lone Rangers team has 11-5 record, roughly equal to the Jazz team and Clippers team. For those who are picky, if only excellent personal data can not lead the team to win, it is likely to be used as a data brush. With such a good record, dongqiqi's position in the league has been improved.
McGrady, a former NBA player, praised dongqiqi very much. "He is becoming my favorite player. I like watching this kid's game very much. He can do anything. It's crazy that he plays so efficiently at that pace. His speed is not the fastest, his athletic ability is not the strongest, but his basketball intelligence is outstanding. With Stephen (curry) injured, he is now the strongest point guard
It's not a single word. On the NBA's official MVP list, dongqiqi is just behind alphabet brother and James.

De Andre Aton
Dongqiqi's performance is so incredible that only the second season will make the 2018 draft a hot topic. Dongqiqi was selected in the third place in 2018. At that time, the eagles had the third place. The lone Rangers completed the deal with the fifth and the first round of 2019. "The more swings you make, the more likely you are to hit the target," said hawk general manager Alan schrenck. It makes sense for us to be able to turn a lottery ticket into two
Maybe it wasn't a bad deal, and Trey young is doing just as well.
But the hot discussion is not just about the deal, but also about two rookies in front of Trey young, Andre Aton and Marvin Bagley. The rookie of de Andre Aton averaged 16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in the season. Considering that the training time of the inside players is a little longer, the future of Aton is still very promising. However, in this season, Aton has been punished by 25 suspension, which will have a certain impact on Aton.

Terre Yang
In a draft, Lotto players will bear certain pressure, and the number one is the most important one to be observed under the microscope. Either way, Aton's performance will be compared with the best players of the same class. Unfortunately, Aton will be compared with Trey young and Dongqi. In terms of the excellent performance of dongqiqi, the pressure on Aton is obviously huge, he needs to play a very good performance to not be questioned by the outside world.
As an example, Michael Jordan was selected as the third best pick at the 1984 draft conference, when the number one winner was "big dream" Olajuwon. Michael Jordan's achievements were the highest among the rookies. Fortunately, the number one player Olajuwon's career was relatively successful, so there was not much controversy. Aton's situation seems to be similar to Olajuwon's, and he has to play well.
It's worth mentioning that NBC sports reporter Kurt Helin recently reported that the Suns didn't choose Luca Dongqi but de Andre Aton at the draft conference because of the promotion of suns boss Robert sawell.

Divac misses East Church
The choice of the Suns may also be understandable. Devon Booker has shown his potential. What the team needs is an inside player to partner with him. Aton can just meet the requirements of the team. For the kings, who hold the top spot, their choice is ironic. Marvin Bagley is the king's choice. It's not that Dalglish's choice is very bad, but the way they miss Dongqi is funny.
NBA reporter Tim McMahon said in the program, "my understanding is that [King's general manager Divac] is close to Luca Dongqi, and his understanding of Dongqi's father has affected their decision. Basically, he didn't like Luca's father and the theory that a father must have a son. It's not like that. Luca is different. You screwed up this time, Vlad. "
For this reason, he gave up a son of God? If so, it would be absurd. When the Lakers chose ronzo Bauer in the 2017 draft conference, they didn't know that old Bauer was so hard to deal with, but the talent of ronzo Bauer made the Lakers covet, so it was finally ronzo Bauer. The kings did not choose Luca Dongqi for this reason, which is undoubtedly a very wrong decision.
