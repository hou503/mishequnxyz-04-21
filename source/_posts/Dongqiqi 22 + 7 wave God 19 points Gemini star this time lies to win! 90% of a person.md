Dongqiqi is in a hot state. He and the lone Rangers have made outstanding performances this season. After beating pelicans, the lone rangers are 14-6 in the fourth place in the West. Dongqiqi won his first month's best award, which didn't make him complacent. He scored 33 points, 18 rebounds and 5 assists in just three quarters against the pelicans.
Such a performance naturally gets the attention of the whole league. Before almost every game, he will become the player that opponents focus on. Before the Timberwolves game, Jeff Teague said, "he is probably the best player in the NBA, so you have to try to get a lot of people to defend him. I'm not sure if it works. It seems that no one can stop him now, so hopefully we can find a way to limit him. "
The Timberwolves started the season with a lot of energy, but their performance has gradually declined since then. They are now ranked seventh in the West 10-9. Timberwolves are in a state of ups and downs. They have only scored 1-4 in five previous games, but they have won both of the last two games and seem to be back on the right track. Can Timberwolves continue to win against lone Rangers?
