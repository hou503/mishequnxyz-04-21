Anthony Davis's super data of 40 points and 20 rebounds in three quarters of the game, playing his representative work of joining the Lakers, ignited staples' passion and dream. Most of the time, the goal of winning the championship will make people enthusiastic, but if it's just so obviously not enough, the long regular season must play some beautiful games, just like there must be some appetizers before a big meal.
The Lakers were defeated by the Clippers in the first game of the new season. They were questioned for a short time, but the adjustment of the team was relatively rapid, and the record of three consecutive wins was the best proof. But the Lakers are just at the beginning, and they need to keep the momentum going, as James said before, "we will continue to build trust on and off the court, which will help us play better in the game."
Next up for the Lakers will be an away trip, where they will play Rangers, spurs and bulls on three separate road trips. However, the team got good news when they started their trip away. Kuzma will be back in the game against the lone Rangers away from home, so that the Lakers' lineup is nearly complete. The only major player the Lakers can't play is Rajan Rondo.

Why is the Lakers in trouble? First of all, the Lakers completely lost the rebound to the lone Rangers, the team rebounded 41-61 behind, offensive rebounds 6-18 behind; second, the Lakers lost all three-point goal, the team's three-point goal only 32-9, Davis and Kuzma 9-0; third, the Lakers lack a holding point, too dependent on LeBron James, once James is not on the court, the attack will be chaotic.
