**It's a contest about talent and perseverance, which ended with the Lakers' victory over Timberwolves. The three "old champions" staged a vivid talent teaching lesson in front of the two "new champions". **On the Lakers side, Anthony Davis scored 50 points, while LeBron James easily contributed 32 points and 13 assists. On the Timberwolves side, Carl Anthony Downes scored 19 points, 4 rebounds and 8 assists, and Andrew Wiggins also scored 19 points.
For Anthony Davis and Downes, this game is still Kentucky's two generations of internal confrontation, senior brother Anthony Davis beat junior brother Downes. Former NBA player Perkins wrote on social media: "after watching ad (Anthony Davis) score 50 points in front of big Kats tonight, I turn on the air conditioner to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and two fans blow in my face. It's just crushing!!!"

Downes and Davis
After Downes entered the league as the number one player, his performance quickly attracted the attention of fans and became the representative of the new generation of center in the league. However, because Downes did not lead the team to play well, and his growth pace is relatively slow, there are some disputes in the league. This kind of growing up experience is similar to Anthony Davis, but Davis's attack and defense are balanced, and they all have great dominance.
Compared with his elder martial brother, Downes's talent is outstanding, but his laziness is questioned. When Jimmy Butler played for Timberwolves, he was not satisfied with the two Timberwolves. He accused the two young players of wasting their talents. Downes and Wiggins have never been able to achieve the expected double number one combination, and this game was severely kicked by the seniors.

Although Downes was extremely frustrated on the court and lost his temper when he was beaten by the Lakers, Downes had unexpected results off the court. "Both teams are playing well, but I personally support number 32, hahaha," singer lizzo said in an interview The reporter confirmed, "Carl Anthony Downes?" Lizzo immediately gave a positive reply, "well, he's my baby."
But don't think too much about it. Lizzo just appreciates Downes because he makes it clear that he doesn't know Downes. Lizzo, who grew up in Houston, moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the Timberwolves live, at the age of 13. After that, lizzo came to Los Angeles to develop, but obviously, she still has deep feelings for the Timberwolves.

"Buyer show" and "seller show"
Lizzo is a "heavyweight" singer. Different from those fancy singers with good looks and body, lizzo weighs 168 Jin. Of course, it's too fat for a woman of 178 cm, but it doesn't affect lizzo's confidence. Not long ago, when lizzo participated in the performance as a guest, she once put on mould's favorite performance clothes and was full of joy.

James iron Rihanna
When it comes to NBA fans, we can't help mentioning Rihanna.
Rihanna is a big fan of LeBron James. No matter where James plays, she will go with her for thousands of miles and express her love for James without any scruples. Although James has been a husband for a long time and has several children, when Rihanna sees her idol James, her eyes still flash with "first love feeling", like a young girl admiring the big brother of the next class.
Lizzie, though not so crazy, could tell her appreciation of Downes from her words.
