With the unfreezing day of player's new contract approaching, the NBA has been busy recently, and the trade rumors begin to frequent the league. Among all the players' trade rumors, Cavaliers' Kevin love is undoubtedly the most real one - the Cavaliers intend to send Kevin love away, and Kevin love also wants to join the championship team, with the same goal.
However, the willingness of both sides is not the only decisive factor, but also depends on the evaluation of the value of Kevin love by the league team. Yes, it is crucial for those interested teams to give up the chips required by the Cavaliers. It's easy to understand. Take the off-season Paul George deal for example. The Clippers are willing to throw enough chips at Paul George. It's hard for thunder to refuse the deal.

Kevin Love 
Kevin love's deal is not so easy. It has something to do with love's recent two seasons. Last season, he played only 22 games for the Cavaliers. But in this season, lefo's condition is also a little volatile. In the first 13 games at the beginning of the season, he played very well, but in recent games, he often failed to score double. Considering the cost-effectiveness of the Kevin love contract, the lure of love in the player market is not great.
**Jason Lloyd, the athletic reporter, reported that a source familiar with the situation revealed that the Cavaliers asked for a first round signing in return, while those interested in lofoy actually wanted a first round signing from the Cavaliers, because lofoy's big contract is three and a half years away. **Kevin Loew and the Cavaliers renew a four-year, $120 million contract in advance, which will not take effect until 2019.

US media reports that the deal may go down
Is it so cruel? No, of course, there will be a turning point. That is the performance of Lefu.
After Jason Lloyd's report, Kevin loeffer broke out against Spurs, scoring 30 points and 17 rebounds in 11 of 24 shots. 30 points set a new high for lefo in a single game this season, and the last time lefo scored at least 30 + 10 was 10 months ago. After a period of depression, Loew found his own game state again, which will undoubtedly make the Cavaliers happy.
After the game, Kevin Loeff also recovered his confidence and said: "against the Spurs, they will continue to put pressure on you. They put out a small lineup on the court, and then suddenly they will change to a large one. We are just catching the opposite position and dealing with different lineups. We have a great rotation, we have a smooth transfer, we are united

Tristan Thompson 
Although the Cavaliers won the game, but the process of the game is not easy, especially at the end of the third quarter, Tristan Thompson had a quarrel with the coach, and Thompson was abandoned by the coach. The Cavaliers led by 10 points in the first three quarters, but the Spurs launched a counter attack in the last quarter. With 20 seconds left, the Spurs led the Cavaliers by 4 points. However, after the success of Sexton's attack, lefo hit the key three points to drag the game into overtime.
The Cavaliers have entered a period of complete corruption, according to US media reports, except Darius garland can be traded in the team. Kevin love's contract is the biggest, and the transaction will be more difficult, but if love can keep its excellent state, it will not lack "buyers". The reason is that there are not many star players in the market. Although lefo is only a star player who has been angry, he still has a certain strength.
