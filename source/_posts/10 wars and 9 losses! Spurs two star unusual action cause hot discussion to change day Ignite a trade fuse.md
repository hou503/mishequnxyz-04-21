The Spurs lost to the Lakers at home. They have lost nine of the last ten games. They just pulled their feet out of the eight straight losses and stepped on them again. Such a sluggish Spurs team has not been seen for many years. Looking back to the downfall of the 1996-97 season more than 20 years ago, it's more like the darkness before dawn, because they then chose Tim Duncan at the draft conference. * *

Gregg Popovich
This time, however, the crisis is quite different.
The Spurs often have problems, but with Duncan, Ginobili and Parker, they can always get out of the doldrums even when they get old. However, with the retirement of Duncan and Ginobili and Parker's departure from the holy city, Popovich no longer has the capital to rebound rapidly. The three old guys have a very harmonious relationship. Like Popovich's father and son, they fully understand what needs to be done.
But now? Kowai Leonard's standoff with the Spurs is enough to show that some things, those players can not be asked, Popovich is not the God who can handle everything. San Antonio's problems have become more and more complicated in the past two years. Aldridge and Derozan are both good players, but they are difficult to be leaders of the team. While paddy mills has experience and experience, his personal ability is not at the top level.

Media coverage of spurs double stars
"I know what you want to say, but to be honest, we have a lot of other things to worry about. There are enough problems in the dressing room and on the court that we need to focus on. We have to play better, one game at a time. "
As soon as Mills's words were said, they were interpreted by the media from various angles, pointing to the problems in the Spurs' dressing room.
Although most media interpretations have no basis, the Spurs' problems are real - of course, if any team loses much, the outside world will enlarge the problems. After some things happened, the outside world of the Spurs to the climax of speculation, seems to be more like a confirmed relationship. Drozan emptied his social media, while dejangtai Murray shut down the Spurs.

Drozan empties social media
Before the Spurs' game against the Lakers, basketball media hoop central reported that drozan had emptied social media. And according to the media, the last time drogban cleared instagram content was when he was traded by the Raptors to the Spurs. As a result, drozan's move to clear his social media account has led to speculation, and rumors of a deal have been raging before.
Dezhangtai Murray has just renewed his contract with the Spurs in the off-season, and despite a one-year hiatus from injury, the Spurs have offered him a four-year, $64 million contract. Dezhangtai Murray is the most important guard player of the Spurs. After coming back in the new season, he has performed well. In addition to the poor three-point shooting, he has improved in many aspects. However, he has shut down the Spurs, which inevitably leads to imagination.

Murray's Spurs
San Antonio is a team that is not very keen on trade. They will not change the current situation of the team through big trade unless they have to, for example, get drozan from the Raptors. But now there are several problems to face: first of all, the team's poor record, the Spurs have fallen to the 13th place in the West; second, the issue of delozan's renewal is pending, the Spurs will let him leave in the summer for nothing? One more thing, the team's locker room is in trouble.
Will the Spurs choose to trade when December 15 arrives? And can this ignite the trading fuse? For the Spurs, it's a real problem.
