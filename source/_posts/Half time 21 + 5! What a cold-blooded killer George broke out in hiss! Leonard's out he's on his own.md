The Clippers continued their journey away from home. The results of the previous two games were quite different. They were beaten by the bucks and then beat the Wizards. The road trip continues, and with Leonard out, the game against the Pacers will be another tough one. What's missing, though, is that Paul George played seven seasons with the Pacers, and this time he's back in Indiana against the old owners.

George plays for the Pacers
What's Paul George thinking? Those memories of the past must come to mind, familiar with the stadium and fans, unfamiliar with the fans' attitude towards him. The boos had some impact on Paul George, who had missed the first four outside shots, and the clippers were in a rather low offensive position. Fortunately, the walkers' hand feel is also cold, both sides frequently hit the iron on the field, and the competition became a boring competition of turn back running.
But with four-and-a-half minutes left in the first quarter, Paul George's fifth three-point shot finally hit. As an all-star player, Paul George's attack threat has always been there. In the first quarter, the hand feeling of the game was not good, but the hand feeling of the second half warmed up, with 10 points and 3 rebounds in 3 of 7 shots in a single game. Led by Paul George, the Clippers led the Pacers 24-19 in the first quarter.

Once glorious years
In the second quarter, the Clippers felt better in attack and gradually expanded their leading edge. However, after Paul George's rotation, they still performed well. Two more three-point shots. At the end of the first half, Paul George made 5 of 13 shots (including 3-pointers, 10 shots and 4 shots) with 21 points, 5 rebounds and 1 steal. Paul George has a plus or minus of + 17 and is tied with Beverly for the Clippers' top player.
At the end of the half-time game, the Clippers led the Pacers 60-48, and Paul George was a cold-blooded killer.
