After the Lakers beat the thunder at home, they went to play another game away. Can the thunder finish the revenge? For the thunder, the Lakers are a strong opponent, but they are not afraid of the best Lakers in the league. It's also well understood that the thunder team is not optimistic before the start of the season. All they can do is to fight with their opponents and always put themselves in a lower position, which is called "barefoot is not afraid to wear shoes".

James
The two teams played fiercely in the previous game. The Lakers were only four points ahead of each other two minutes before the end of the season, but the Lakers did a good job in defense. Finally, the Lakers beat the thunder 112-107. However, there was a heated discussion after the penalty game. Afterwards, the referee's report also showed that there was a miscalculation in the game - James did not foul Gary's cover and it was a wrong call to punish him at the critical moment.
Of course, the game is over, the two sides will continue to play another game, this game transferred to Oklahoma. The two sides are still playing a tense and sticky game. The thunder team at home is stuck with the Lakers at the beginning of the game. The Lakers are stuck by the thunder team, so it's hard to play the rhythm they want to play. At the end of the half-time game, the thunder led by one point 67-66.

Popper
At the beginning of the first quarter, the thunder played very actively, and the Lakers tried to catch up and even the score. In the second half of the first quarter, the Lakers gradually gained the lead in shooting efficiency. With Dennis Schroeder's attack, the Lakers only led the thunder by one point 34-33. The attack of both teams was smooth, and the score in the first quarter was not low.
Into the second quarter of the game, the gluing situation continues, it is difficult for either side to expand the difference. The thunder gradually widened the gap in the second half of the game, but with pop's three-point shot, the Lakers made it 66-67, and the Lakers were 1 point behind. This shows how tight the score is, with the Lakers leading 1 point in the first quarter and 1 point at the end of the first half.

Bradley
It's worth mentioning that Popper scored 9 points in the second quarter. Will Popper's law work again?
Pop didn't score a point in the first quarter, but with 5:33 left in the second quarter, Donovan's referee complained about a technical foul, and pop's technical foul free throw hit the first point of the game. Pop seems to have found a shooting touch, and since then he has scored 5 points in a row. The most beautiful goal was 2.4 seconds before the end of the first half. The Lakers served in the back of the last attack and threw it to James in the front to pass it to pop, who hit the three-point post.
In the second quarter of Pope's game, he made 3-for-5 shots (including 3-for-3 shots and 2-for-2 shots) and 1-for-1 free throw, contributing 9 points.

Vogel
For Pope, he was not in good shape at the beginning of the season. For a time, he became "mascot" because of "pop's law", and his annual salary of 8 million was questioned. However, pop was not depressed. In recent games, due to Bradley's injury, pop's condition gradually improved. Before that, I started three games in a row, and I was able to score double points in each game, and I had a good outside shooting feel.
For Lakers coach Vogel, pop's excellent performance is undoubtedly a "happy worry". How to arrange the starting lineup after Bradley's return?
