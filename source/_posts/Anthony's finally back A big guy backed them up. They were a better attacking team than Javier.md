Cameron Anthony signed the trailblazer team, and the voice of congratulation came in an endless stream in the league. James made seven consecutive developments, expressing his inner excitement. James and Anthony have a close personal relationship, and Anthony is often associated with the Lakers, but Anthony has not been able to join the Lakers. **Wandering for a long time, the trailblazers became the harbor of his inner habitat. * *
Not only is James excited about Anthony's signing, but Allen Iverson, a former NBA superstar, also congratulated him. Iverson's career also has a wandering experience in his later years. Maybe he will have a deeper understanding of Anthony's current situation. He wrote on social media: * * "thank the trailblazers for giving my brother Cameron Anthony a chance! Show yourself, show your killer! " * *

Iverson has always been supporting Anthony. Last season, when Anthony was questioned and given up, Iverson said: "people's life will face some tests, which is one of the difficulties you have to overcome. He will find a way to adapt to the game and find his place at the same time. I believe in him, I know he's strong. He has family and friends behind him. I really think he will be OK. I will always support him. "
During his career, Iverson worked with Anthony as a teammate of the Nuggets. Iverson played for the 76ers for more than 11 seasons, and was traded to the nuggets by the 76ers. Anthony, who was only a fourth grade player at that time, has become a signature player of the Nuggets. **Veteran Iverson and young talent Anthony met in Denver and wrote a short story about the killer. * *

"Gold double gun"
Iverson is the top player in the league. Before he was traded to the Nuggets, he had become the league's scoring champion four times. Iverson played 15 games for the 76ers in the traded 2006-07 season, averaging 31.2 points, 7.3 assists and 2.2 steals. Anthony is also very good at scoring, known as the "attack kaleidoscope", a season before Iverson, can get 26.5 points per game.
The pair of two fierce attacking players, known as the "golden double gun", made Nuggets a team with high visibility at that time. The Nuggets seem to have a special interest in a winning combination, with Chichi van der wich and Alex inglish in the '80s. Iverson's partner with Anthony became one of the best attacking duo in the league.

US media discussion on the attack Duo
American media "the ringer" once published an article two months ago. Iverson and Anthony ranked fifth in the "best attack duo in history", ranking higher than Durant and Westbrook, LeBron James and Dwayne Wade, etc. It is worth mentioning that the article is not the best two-man group ranking, but the result of calculating the season performance of the offensive combination.
Iverson and Anthony's partner attack fierce fire, but they did not lead the Nuggets to play too good results, after stopping in the first round of the playoffs, the Nuggets quickly split the pair. Ironically, in the first season after the deal, the Nuggets reached the Western Conference finals under Anthony and Billups. Iverson, who was traded to the pistons, has gone to the end of his career there.
Now in retrospect, it's still very sad.
