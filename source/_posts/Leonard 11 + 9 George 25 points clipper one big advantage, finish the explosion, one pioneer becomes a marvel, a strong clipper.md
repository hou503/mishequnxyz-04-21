When Paul George talked about the team's performance, he said: "we all have different attacking styles, we all played the core of the team's attack. Now we have to learn how to play around each other. We have different roles and we have a lot of work to do. " George's words are true. There is not much reference value in winning the Wizards. The opponent's defense is not good.
