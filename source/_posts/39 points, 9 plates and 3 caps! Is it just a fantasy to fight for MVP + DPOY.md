Anthony Davis is a great offensive shooter, and the Lakers rely on him for a lot of times. Davis doesn't just do this, he does more on the defensive side, and he's the Lakers' defense gate. **Davis put forward higher requirements for his defense. He wanted to make a combination of Howard and Garnett. Howard's defensive end dominated the paint area, interfered with the opponent's shooting, and was as tough as Garnett. * *
