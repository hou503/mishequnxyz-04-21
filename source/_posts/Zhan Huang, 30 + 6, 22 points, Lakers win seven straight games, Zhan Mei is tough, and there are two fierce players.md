From Los Angeles to Oklahoma, the Lakers and the thunder played two games in a row. The winners were the Lakers, so the Lakers continued to enjoy the best record in the league. However, it was not easy to play both games. The thunder team just regretted losing the game. When talking about the result, Chris Paul said sadly: "it's stupid. I don't know if the word is appropriate, but it's stupid. We have to solve this problem."
In the past few games, the Lakers' defense is not as good as that at the beginning of the season, but the team's attack has changed, especially the outside shooting. In the past three games, they have done quite well. In the last away game of thunder, the Lakers made 17 of 31 three-point shots, which became one of the key factors to win the game. For the Lakers, their chemistry is getting better.
Away against the Grizzlies, the Lakers will face each other for the second time this season, winning a big victory in the first game. In that game, Anthony Davis was almost unstoppable, contributing 40 points and 20 rebounds of super data. For the second time this season, how will the Grizzlies defend Davis? What will be the result of the game?

Dwight Howard
Rondo got two points at the beginning of the last game. Kuzma fouled three shots and two fouls on the outside. The Lakers started 4-0 and stopped the Grizzlies. Back in the game, each side scored a three-point goal, Rondo snatched the counter attack layup, and the Lakers led by 7 points. The Grizzlies returned with a 7-0 draw, 94-0.
The game was pretty tight, Morant was 2 + 1 and the Grizzlies were 5 points ahead. Pop made two penalties for two fouls, Anthony Davis hit a three-point goal, and the Lakers tied 105. LeBron James attack again, the Lakers played significantly more tough key ball, the role of superstar to play out. Morant grabbed the wrong layup, the Lakers didn't attack, the Grizzlies got the last chance.
The Grizzlies made a key first attack mistake, and the Lakers narrowly beat the Grizzlies 109-108, winning a wave of seven consecutive victories.
The Lakers' back-to-back game, physical fitness and concentration are affected to some extent, and the Grizzlies' outside shooting is excellent, and the Lakers are behind the Grizzlies for a period of time. However, compared with the two superstars led by the Lakers, the Grizzlies are obviously too young, and the key ball ability of the Lakers is better than the Grizzlies. But the Lakers made a mistake in the last minute and gave the Grizzlies a chance, but the Grizzlies didn't catch it.
In addition to the outstanding performances of the two superstars, Howard and Rondo did well in this game.
