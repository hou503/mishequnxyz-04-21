Jimmy Butler 
Montemorris was so hot that the Denver Nuggets expanded their lead to 26 points with a 6-0 start to the third quarter. Pause back to the game, the offensive side a little bit of gains, but it is difficult to stop the Nuggets scoring, the game situation is difficult to change. The heat couldn't change the situation of the game, and the game entered the garbage time early. Finally, the Nuggets beat the heat 109-89.
Throughout the game, the heat's away game obviously has not been able to enter the state, the offensive end has always been unable to find the feeling. The Nuggets are not only more talented players, but also the core of the team, which can keep the team stable. The heat lack of a player who can connect the team, which also makes the attack efficiency of the whole game extremely low.
The trip to the West was a bit difficult.
