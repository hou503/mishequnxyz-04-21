With the heat of beating the Lakers, the Raptors began another challenge. The back-to-back game against the clippers is undoubtedly a more difficult task for the Raptors. At present, the Raptors are facing a wave of injuries, Kyle Lori, Ibaka can not play for the team, making the team's rotation lineup stretched. Against the Lakers, the three substitutes of the Raptors performed well, which became an important reason to beat the Lakers.
The situation of raptors is relatively difficult, but there are many gains in the predicament, so the rotation team can be expanded. Chris Bucher, Jefferson and Terence Davis all played well on the Raptors' bench, and Matt Thomas also had the ability to surprise. **These names, which may or may not have been heard, have become a very important part of the game for the Raptors. * *
The game against the Clippers was even worse, with anunobi breaking his eye when Leonard snatched him from the basket, just two minutes before the start of the game. What does this mean for the Raptors? Anunoby's 30 minutes per game will be filled by other players. **As for the rotation of the lineup, the team of raptors was already stretched to the limit. However, the team of raptors did not retreat and went up in the face of difficulties. * *

Leonard's under attack
**When the picture is exhausted, the Raptors suddenly jump up and fight hard. The cold blade flashes cold light in the moonlight. * *
The Raptors obviously had a thorough study of the clippers, and knew that it would take half of the Clippers' life to catch Cowie Leonard. It's also known in the league, at least before the return of Paul George, the Clippers' squad had some flaws. But how easy is it to grasp it? But the Raptors have a "natural advantage". Leonard played for the Raptors last season. Nick NASS may know Leonard better than Doug rivers. * *
Out of the understanding of Leonard's playing habits, the Raptors' bag is quite firm, * * two or three people then prepare a net, as long as Leonard takes the ball, he will jump over. **The Raptors' defense against Leonard is very aggressive, which brings great trouble for Leonard to deal with the ball. Although Leonard's assists per game are increasing this season, Leonard is not the top passer, so there are too many mistakes in the game.
Coway Leonard has never been difficult, the whole game played an alternative "quasi four doubles" performance - 2 of 11 contribution 12 points 11 rebounds 9 assists and 9 mistakes. Among them, 9 mistakes in a single game is the highest in his career. Leonard has made 8 mistakes before, which happened in the game against the thunder when he played for the Raptors last season. The Raptors lost the game, but the Clippers won the game after nine mistakes.

Leonard played for the Raptors last season
Players in the long career will always play some abnormal games, such as Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant have been single game scoring less than double game, LeBron James single game 11 times of fault play "alternative four pairs" and so on. Coway Leonard has been very stable for many years. His expressionless face is called a robot. He seldom makes mistakes in the game, so his nine mistakes in a single game will be noticed.
When talking about the game after the game, Leonard spoke highly of his former teammates. He thought the Raptors' defense was more aggressive in any game last season. Leonard said in an interview: "they are very good in the game, they are very good in defense, they take more physical confrontation, but I like them to do so. It makes me better and my teammates better
These words can show Leonard's EQ, which is totally different from the stereotype he left to the league. Leonard praised both the defense of the Raptors and the performance of the Clippers' players, which made people sound more useful. When the Clippers win, Leonard's poor performance will be covered up, and Leonard still has some highlights at the end of the game, proving his outstanding personal ability.

Van fleet contribution 14 points
Before the start of the game, van Fleet said he wanted to guard against Leonard. "We've sanctioned green. We're going to try to sanction Cohen next time." Danny green didn't score a point against the Raptors, and Leonard didn't do well under the Raptors' hard defense. "We definitely punished him in this game, our defensive focus is on him, and 4-5 people will fight against him physically, which makes him uncomfortable," Van Fleet said after the game
At the end of the fun trip to Los Angeles, the Raptors left with their heads held high.
For Cowie Leonard, it was just a normal game. Although he didn't perform well in the game, the team won the final victory. Maybe the Clippers will be questioned. If other teams follow the Raptors, Doug rivers is very confident about it. "You can imagine, when Cohen (Leonard), Lowell and George are present at the same time, you go to pack them and Harrell. Please feel free to pack. They can try. "
Maybe it's Leonard's toughest regular season game of the season.
