Under the complicated situation in the west, the Lakers occupy the top position 10-2, the team is running in and out of a difficult road full of tears. It's not easy for the Lakers to get such a record, even with some luck. This Lakers team hasn't reached its best, especially the situation of shooting outside is worse, which makes the start of the new season not as easy as the result.
Therefore, although the Lakers ranked first in the west, the US media still gave the Lakers some trade suggestions. Jonathan gilnan of fanside's Lake show life recently proposed three mid-season deals for the Lakers - Pop for Grizzlies Jay Claude, Rajan Rondo for trailblazers hyzonia and Dudley for nets player novaba.

US media suggested that pop replace Claude
First of all, we must declare that these three transactions are purely personal analysis of American media journalists.
But what's more interesting is that pop is the "lucky star" of the Lakers, and the magic of pop's law still works, and he did well against the kings in the game, is he really going to be traded? If you can change pop to Claude, it's certainly a deal to try. As mentioned in gilnan's analysis, Claude can provide defensive help when James and green are not present.
But will the Grizzlies agree to such a deal? Why did they accept Pope and give up Claude? Although Claude is not as good as gilnan said, Claude is not a reliable outside pitcher, but pop is not more suitable than Claude. The Grizzlies have no reason to accept pop's contract. Maybe considering the expiration of Claude's contract, grizzlies didn't want to keep him, while pop's contract expires in 2021.

Andre Iguodala
In fact, there is no practical significance to discuss the rationality of the transaction itself. What should be seen is the problem behind the transaction.
Why did the idea of the deal emerge? The root cause is that the Lakers' frontline strength is still questioned. Is the Lakers' frontline strength not enough? It's amazing that a team with James, Davis and Kuzma "three giants" has been questioned about its frontline strength. But look at Los Angeles city rivals clippers, maybe we can get a clear answer.
The clippers have Leonard and Paul George. The explosive force of such a combination is quite amazing. Although they haven't formally combined, the ability of two people to lead the team alone has already shown the future of terror. After Paul George came back, he played two games and scored 70 points in 44 minutes. How can such a good performance not make people worry about the Lakers team?

Leonard and George
Gilnan's trade proposal is not aimed at the performance of Paul George after his comeback, but at the loopholes in the Lakers' lineup, which is the important reason why the Lakers have been linked with igodara. Los Angeles twins are bound to become the main champions in the western part of the league, and the lineup configuration of the Clippers seems to be stronger. The Lakers must improve the matching degree of the lineup as much as possible, so that they are more likely to beat the Clippers.
The management of the Lakers naturally pays more attention to the situation of the team, and will make transaction preparation according to the situation of the team at any time. The Lakers don't need to make great changes. How to make the lineup more reasonable is the goal pursued by the management. There are some problems in the Lakers' lineup. The trade is not impossible, but every trade is not easy. It is the most important thing for the team to solve the problem by adjusting itself.
