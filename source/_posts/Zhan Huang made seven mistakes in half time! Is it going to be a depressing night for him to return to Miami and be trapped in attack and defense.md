"Three giants" appear in the heat
Jimmy Butler, who joined the heat in the offseason, said of his opponent LeBron James before the game: "he (James) always takes care of his body, he is super smart, and I think everyone is eager to achieve his state. Peak state? Is he still at the top? Who knows? Maybe or maybe not? But he's still very efficient and he's one of the best players in the game
It looks easy before the game, but it's different when it comes to the game.
The heat, who have won 11 games in a row at home, are well prepared, and the players are full of infinite vitality. They are fully committed to the game from the beginning of the game. Meyers Leonard's outside shooting helped the heat break the deadlock first. Although the game remained stalemate, the heat played more actively, resolutely and boldly. Kendrick Nunn's dunk against McGrady is the best portrayal of the heat's form.

Although the heat played a positive and bright first quarter, it was the Lakers who led at the end of the first quarter. However, in the second quarter of the game, the advantage of the heat's rotation lineup gradually emerged, which kept the score open, at most, it was 14 points ahead. The Lakers are quite passive on the scene, the heat's defensive strategy makes the Lakers miserable.
James in the second quarter of the game is still not easy, under the heat's encirclement and suppression, there are too many mistakes, and in the offensive end facing the opponent's strict defense. At the end of the first half, James scored 11 points in 4 of 11 shots, and made up to 7 mistakes. Back in Miami, James had to show a better performance. In the first half, the Lakers were 8 points behind. The Lakers had to work harder.
