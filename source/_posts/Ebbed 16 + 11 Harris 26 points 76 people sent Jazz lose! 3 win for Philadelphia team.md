The Jazz's trip to Philadelphia to play against the 76ers will give some people some feeling that they are not the team they expected after the start of the season. The 76ers and Jazz have invested a lot in the players' market. They should be the pursuers of the championship. However, after the start of the season, they wrote the word "difficult" on their faces. Although the results of the two teams are not too bad to be accepted, it is obviously not enough for them.
However, the 76ers have gradually found their own form, and winning seven of the past eight games is the best proof. But after losing to the Raptors, the shameful and brave Benedict brought great help to the team. He talked about his changes and said: "in Toronto, I didn't get a point. After that, I reflected on myself. Now I have changed my mind. I was not aggressive enough before. Now I have changed it. "

Al Horford 
The 76ers' squad is competitive, but they need to be stronger. As the two cores of the team and the future, embid and Simmons play an important role. As a representative of the young players, Donovan Mitchell has been a bit bad recently, and his shooting efficiency in the past two games is not high. The Jazz are also going through an awkward 1-3 journey. Can they end the embarrassment in Philadelphia?
Mike Conley started shooting and Simmons responded. The Jazz got into a quick start, leading 9-4, but the 76ers responded with a 12-4 offensive climax and quickly completed the counter lead. The advantage of the 76ers' two inner team combination is obvious, and the first game of hofford is even hotter, so the 76ers also suppress the Jazz team in the attack and maintain the leading position in the Jazz team.
Jeff Green scored two points and the 76ers finished 7-0, ending the first quarter with the 76ers leading 31-23.
