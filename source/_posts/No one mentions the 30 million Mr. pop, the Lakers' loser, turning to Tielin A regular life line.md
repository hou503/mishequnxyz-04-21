The Lakers, who won seven games in a row, probably didn't expect the Raptors to end their streak. This is not to say that losing Leonard's strength of the Raptors is not good, and the new season's performance of the Raptors is not bad. The problem of the Raptors is the fierce injury - the main players of the team Kyle Lori and Sergi Ibaka are both absent, which is a huge blow to the Raptors who are not deep enough in the lineup.
But it was the Raptors that beat the mighty Lakers away.
The Raptors did encounter a lack of depth in the game, but the fierce players on the bench, Chris Bucher, Terence Davis and Jefferson, and so on, came out one after another, making the Lakers have no way to deal with them for a while. Maybe before the game, the names of these players were rarely mentioned (Jefferson played in the nets and dropped out of the starting lineup last season), but they gave the Lakers a deadly three board ax.

Popper
The Lakers are relatively well-organized. Only Rajan Rondo can get into the rotation team. Why can't he help the rest of the Raptors? It's really like the "pop's law" that Lakers fans say. If pop can only score, the Lakers won't lose. In this game, pop didn't score a point. When the Lakers lost the opening game, pop didn't score a point. Is it really the "pop's law" at work?
Popper only played four minutes in this game. He didn't score a point in 0-for-2 shooting and only had one rebound in technical statistics. However, it is surprising that the positive and negative value of Popper's four minutes is as low as - 10, that is to say, the team lost 10 points in his time. When did pop play? At the end of the first quarter, I played more than three minutes. It was when the Raptors were chasing points, and at the end of the second quarter, I played less than a minute.
Although Pop was chased when he was there, the Lakers were still in the lead until half-time.

Danny Green 
It's strange to look at pop's numbers. His performance in the new season is not good enough. It's unfair to be regarded as the only culprit of the Lakers' loss. In the game against the Raptors, Danny green was also a Lakers player who didn't score. Green didn't score a point in 5-0 shots, and four three-point shots failed to reach a goal. Facing the team-mates who won the title together last season, Danny green seems to have some problems.
Why is Danny green getting a higher salary and not being questioned? First of all, Danny Green's shooting efficiency is good, the three-point shooting rate is about 40%; second, Danny Green's defensive role will greatly increase his performance.
In fact, it's not the case. Danny Green's three-point shooting rate seems to be good, mainly because of a large amount of money saved in 7 of 9 three-point shots in the opening game, which gives Danny green a space to spend. Danny Green's outside shooting is not good enough in the last four games. In four games, three-point shots are 15-for-3, and four games are 14 points in total. Is Danny green really good?

Lakers Twin Towers
The loss of the Lakers is not the problem of one or two people, but the problem of the whole team. The attack of the Lakers is not good enough, which is undoubtedly the case. The reason why we can keep the momentum of seven consecutive wins is that the team's defense is well done. Once the defense is not good, there will be problems in the game against the Raptors, and the loss will inevitably appear in the Lakers.
"Pop's law" is more like a joke, the real law should be found in defense. There is such a rule that is more suitable for the Lakers. If the opponent scores more than 110 points, the Lakers can hardly win the game. The game lost to the Raptors lost 113 points, the game lost to the Clippers lost 112 points. In addition to these two games, the game lost points against the lone Rangers and the bulls were also around 110 points, and the two games almost lost.
In summary, the Lakers' offense is not good enough. They can only win the game by defense.
