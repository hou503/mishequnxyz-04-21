The Clippers beat the pelicans and finished the race perfectly with a wave of five wins at home. The Clippers didn't play smoothly in every game, but they won the first two games and the last two, and the three games in the middle were pretty glum and they all laughed at the end. Against the eagles, the Clippers beat their opponents by 49 points, while the pelicans won by 25 points.

Leonard hit Bauer on the back
At the beginning of the season, Paul George was out of action for injuries. In the first three games of Paul George's return, Cowie Leonard was out of action for injuries. Since the formation of the super team of clippers, the two core players of the team have only played three games together, and the Clippers that still need to run in are far from the best condition. In this period of time, the Clippers still show the depth of the lineup.
Against Celtic, Paul George and Leonard had a difficult time getting together for the first time. In that game, the clippers were forced to the corner and played an extra time game to win the game. The Clippers didn't do what they were expected to do. Leonard didn't attack efficiently in that game, and Paul George didn't do his best. What did the Clippers rely on to win the game? Lineup depth.

Fans pull George up
The depth of the lineup is obviously the capital that the Clippers are proud of. In the game against Celtic, Beverly was like a vicious dog biting his opponent. He eventually contributed 14 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks. And Louis Williams, who scored 27 points in the game. When the opponent plays the big card, the Clippers still have the hind move, which is their strength.
The same is true for the pelicans. Although the pelicans played very hard in the second half of the game, they were completely defeated in the rotation. The starting lineup of clippers is not strong enough. Paul George is even used as a 3D player. It's just an outrage. But it doesn't matter. When the starting lineup doesn't play well, the substitutes are able to snatch points crazily on the field.

Monteiz Harrell
When the Clippers' leading difference is within ten, Luwei and Harrell, the league's strongest second team, will make the opponent's team unable to cope on the court. The two players play together for a long time and have a very high degree of tacit understanding. They are the best team against the opponent's backup team. Compared with the pelicans' reserve team, the opponent is obviously not at the same level.
Harrell killed the four sides in the game, 34 points and 12 rebounds in 13 of 18 shots; Wayne was also very efficient in attack, 19 points in 6 of 11 shots. The positive and negative values can reflect the difference between the two teams. Except etowan Moore, the main substitute of Pelican team is almost below - 20; the main substitute of clipper team is all above + 25.
Harrell said after the game: "we have a good squad depth, in any night, players will have three or four guys come out, play wonderful performance, this is very good."

Patrick Beverly
Clippers coach Doug rivers has been very satisfied with the team's condition, talking about the depth of the team is more than happy. Speaking about the current situation of the team, he said: "we are still growing, I guess we can win some games when we are not playing very well, because we can prevent opponents. When we play on our own turf, we do well on the offensive side
It's certainly the Clippers' biggest asset, and they don't have to be like some teams running in to lose. The Clippers haven't played their best yet, but they have a lot of weapons to choose from on the offensive and defensive ends, so they haven't been dragged down by running in. After the bittersweet home match, the Clippers will go to the away match. Can they get better in the running in?
