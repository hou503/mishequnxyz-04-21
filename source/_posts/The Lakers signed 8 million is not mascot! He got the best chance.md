The Lakers played a very tight game against the kings, and Bogdanovic broke through the layup with 22.1 seconds left. When it came to the Lakers' offensive round, James fouled Barnes' defense. James made two free throws at the critical moment, leaving the kings 5.5 seconds. In the king's final attack, Barnes took the ball and shot it back, but Davis blocked the attack.
The Lakers beat the kings 99-97.
**It's so hard to play, because the Lakers are not good enough in attack, the team's shooting rate is only 42%, the second lowest since the start of the new season. **When the first quarter was 10 points behind, the Lakers leveled the difference before the end of the first half of the game, and the Lakers didn't shoot well enough, so that the whole game fell into a bitter battle with the kings. But the Lakers are good at playing the key ball and beating the kings hard.

James's cut off opponent
Although the Lakers won hard, but also have unexpected gains, pop in this game to play well.
After the Lakers extended their contract in the offseason, pop didn't perform well, but was tired of "pop's law" and became the mascot of the team. So far, the so-called "pop's law" still works. As long as it's a game that pop can score, the Lakers all win. Against the kings, pop scored 16 points, but this time he was no longer the mascot.
Bradley was out with injury and pop started his second time this season, but he didn't do well in the first three quarters. Pop in the game is not efficient, this season has been used to people, but this time Pop has brought great surprise to the fans. Pop's performance in this game, almost all coagulated in the fourth quarter of the game, a single quarter game 6-5 to get 12 points.

"Pop's law" spread on the Internet
James talked about pop after the game, he praised the teammate and said: "we need the attitude of the next man to come forward, tonight is KCP (POP), he played very well in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. He shot confidently, hitting some layups under the basket. Especially on the defensive end, he pestered buddy hild at the end of the game. The game ball should be given to KCP. "
Pop joined the Lakers was very expected, but failed to play the expected performance, his outside shooting ability is not good. Last season, Pope's three-point shooting rate was only 34.7%. As a striker type player who is badly needed by James, Pope's 12 million contract a year has been widely questioned. The Lakers signed a two-year contract extension of 16 million during the offseason, and his three-point shooting rate dropped to 29.6%.

Pop is getting better
As a team competing for the title, pop is under great pressure, and Bradley's performance is good and cost-effective. Pop needs to be questioned. Popper urgently needs to play with the performance of redemption in line with his value, to calm the voice of ridicule, doubt and ridicule. It's not enough to change people's view of him. He needs to do more.
Of course, Pope knows his situation, he is also trying to play better, but it can't be explained by just one game. "One of the things I've been doing is I want to get my confidence back," he said of his performance after the game. If I can play a good game, I won't... There will be fans cheering for me. "
Bradley will still have a truce, which is a good opportunity for Pope.
