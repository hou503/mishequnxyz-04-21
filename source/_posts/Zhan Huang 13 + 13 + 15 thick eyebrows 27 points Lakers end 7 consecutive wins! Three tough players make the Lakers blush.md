After losing the opening game, the Lakers won seven in a row, which earned them the top spot in the West.
The Lakers can play such a record, defense is the key to the success of the team, Vogel said recently: "when you play a good defense, your attack can withstand ups and downs. Our analysis team reported that we were interfering with 88% of our opponents' shots in the game. I don't know if I've ever understood that, but (I understand) our players have done a great job on the defensive side
The Lakers haven't fully developed their offense, but defense has been able to give them an advantage in the game. Kuzma, who just came back from the injury, said about his attacking state: "the attacking state will come after all, but the most important thing is to strive to keep sharpening and focusing on the defensive side and try to prevent the opponent, which is the way we win."
To continue the regular season at home, the Lakers will face the challenge of the Raptors. The new season's performance of the Raptors is amazing. Although the team has lost the core player Covey Leonard, the start of the new season is 6-2, ranking second after Celtic. But Kyle Lowry's broken left thumb against the pelicans will affect the performance of the Raptors for some time.
Can the remaining Raptors surprise Los Angeles?

After the start of the game, LeBron James made a mistake in passing, the Raptors attacked, and mark Gasol missed his three-point shot. However, Bradley took the lead in breaking the deadlock by shooting three points, and mark Gasol shot two points for the Lakers. Bradley's offense was excellent. The Lakers had a 10-3 lead at the start of the game, Powell had a good shot, and the Lakers called a timeout.
Anthony Davis and James each play an attack. Powell becomes a wonder on the court of the Lakers. Scoring continuously helps the Raptors narrow the gap. Powell hit a three-point goal, and van fleet also hit a three-point goal. The Raptors were 5 points behind. The team of raptors is incomplete and needs all players to make contributions on the field. The performance of raptors at the beginning of the game is basically satisfactory.
The Lakers hit a wave of 6-0, and after the difference was pulled back again, Terence Davis hit a three-point goal, and the Raptors hit a wave of 9-0, only two points short. Quinn cook and Anthony Davis each made one attack, with the Lakers leading by six points. Matt Thomas was amazing at the end of the first quarter, scoring five points for the Raptors.

Kyle Kuzma

Chris Bucher scored two points for the Raptors in the last game, and the attack of the Raptors also started. The final game started with a 13-3 score, and the Lakers directly lagged the Raptors by 10 points. The Lakers were in trouble with the offense and the game was a bit of a mess, with Kuzma scoring a three-point goal. The Lakers called a timeout. After the timeout, Caruso was successful in attacking, but it was still difficult to stop the Raptors' attack.
The Raptors see the hope of winning, the team seems to be high morale, and the Lakers tough confrontation. James got the attack, the Lakers were 9 points behind, the Raptors hit 3-pointer in the counterattack, the difference was expanded to 12 points. Kuzma hit two three-point goals, the difference was instantly reduced to 6 points, and the defense of the Lakers also improved. James made two penalties for a foul, and the Lakers were 4 points behind.
At the critical moment, sICAM stopped the decline and shot twice, which widened the difference to 8 points. The Raptors became braver and braver, never flinching in front of the Lakers. Finally, the Raptors beat the Lakers 113-104, winning 10 consecutive games against the Lakers.
The Lakers played well in the first half of the game, but in the second half, the Raptors broke out with amazing strength and once reversed the score on the court. Facing the outbreak of many role players of the Raptors, the Lakers' defense was played in a mess, and they couldn't find the key point of defense. **The Raptors worked hard. In addition to the regular rotation players such as van fleet, cicham and Powell, the three substitutes of Bucher, Jefferson and Terrence Davis scored 38 points. * *
The tenacity of the Raptors is admirable, and they make the Lakers' luxury lineup look bad.
