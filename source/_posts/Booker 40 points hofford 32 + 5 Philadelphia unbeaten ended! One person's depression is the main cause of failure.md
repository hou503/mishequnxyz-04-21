The 76ers played against the trailblazers in the last game. The game was very dangerous and brilliant. Anfenni Simmons almost killed the game with a three-point goal, but colkmaz made a magic three-point goal to finish the final. The 76ers continued their unbeaten momentum in the new season, and the 76ers became the only team in the League to keep unbeaten after the start of the new season.
However, the Western four company guest just started, the 76ers will continue to challenge the Western rivals suns. He was banned from playing two games because of the fight between OBID and Downes. He was still unable to play against the Suns, and the Suns were not an easy team to deal with. Even though Aton was banned at the beginning of the season, the Suns still played 4-2, even beat the clippers, and lost 1 point in both games.
The Suns have made some changes in their lineup in the new season. The most important thing is that Ricky Rubio joined. Rubio is not an efficient scorer, but a quality team organizer. The Suns are a lot more mature in the new season, not as chaotic as they have been in the past few seasons, and the players' morale has been completely reversed when they can win. Against the 76ers, both teams lack the main center. Who will win?
