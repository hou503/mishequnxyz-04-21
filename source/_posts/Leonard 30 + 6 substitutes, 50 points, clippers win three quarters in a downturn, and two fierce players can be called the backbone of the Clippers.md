The Clippers beat the Spurs, breaking the invincibility of their opponents since the start of the game, but the hard schedule is still going on. The clippers have to face a lot of strong enemies in this stage, such as the Jazz team in the west, the trailblazers team, the Bucks team in the East, the Raptors team, etc., so the race is undoubtedly a big test for the Clippers. The clippers have won 4-2 in the new season. One of the defeats is to lose to the jazz. Can the Clippers take revenge on each other for the second time?
It is worth mentioning that the team's strength was greatly influenced by the last time the two teams met and caught up with Cowie Leonard. In that game, Mike Conley found the feeling of playing in the clippers, and the Jazz got the best out of winning. When we play again, all the players of Clippers will not take turns. It will be a game to prove their strength.
After the Jazz off-season adjustment, the performance of the new season is quite good. Despite the cold hand of Mike Conley in the previous games, the Jazz team still achieved a 4-2 record. However, it is a little embarrassing for the Jazz team that they lost to the kings in the last game and won the first game of the new season. Can Jazz beat clippers to avoid losing in a row?

At the end of the game, Luwei and Leonard fired continuously, and the clippers were close to two points.

Bogdanovic made both fouls, Leonard scored his first three-point goal in the game, and the clippers were able to surpass the score.

The Jazz team changed to Mitchell to charge. Mitchell took over the game and soon tied the score. The competition between the two teams became more intense. Jerichael green made three-point shots, Leonard and Harrell kept scoring free throws, and the clippers were nine points ahead. The Jazz's pursuit of points seems weak, and the Clippers did not give the jazz a chance to turn the table. The Clippers beat the Jazz 105-94.
The Clippers didn't perform well in the first three quarters. The whole team felt cold, but in the fourth quarter, the Clippers broke out. When the Clippers won, Leonard's personal ability was still important, and the last game was even more aggressive. What's more, the Clippers' bench has made a great contribution again, with the bench scoring 50 points in total. Under the circumstances of louway's poor performance, Jamie green and Harrell can be regarded as the backbone.
Jamichael Green has 12 points and 6 rebounds, and Harrell has 19 points and 8 rebounds.
