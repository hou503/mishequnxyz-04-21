Lone Rangers win
-* rare talents**
Why does the lone Rangers change so much in the new season? Looking at the scoring data of the team, apart from the 30.1-point average of the lone Rangers, only polzingis and Tim Hathaway can score double points, but the team's integrity is very strong. That is to say, before polzingis did not recover, the lone Rangers were almost driven by the single core dongqiqi, and the role players swarmed into a group fight in the game.
A second grader is at the helm, which is rare in the league. Dongqiqi is undoubtedly a prodigy. His first season in the League shocked people. Everywhere he went, he was surrounded by praise. In recent two years, this kind of thing has not happened. Donovan Mitchell's rookie season has been labeled as the successor of Kobe Bryant. However, if he can further test the talent of players on the basis of a high starting point.
Donovan Mitchell failed to do so, while Luca Dongchi continued to make the league's eyes wide open.

Young talents of the alliance in recent two years
-Continue to create magic**
"You want to defend him, and everyone else wants to defend him. He's averaging 30 points per game now, so he can do what he wants with all the teams. He's really a good player, you can only defend him as much as you can "That's what everyone wants to see, really," continued the pelican manager in an interview. * *
Due to the great lead of the lone Rangers team, dongqiqi only played three quarters in this game, but he still cut 26 points, 6 rebounds and 9 assists. After this game, dongqiqi got at least 20 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 18 consecutive games, which equalled Michael Jordan. How hard is it? In the 2016-17 season, when Westbrook scored 30 + triple doubles per game, he failed to do so.

Luca dongqiqi
-* better than James**
With regard to Luca dongqiqi, there are enough praise voices from the outside world. He has been associated with the legendary star since he was young, and his idol LeBron James is the one who has been compared most. James's talent and potential, he has not yet entered the League when the United States has shaken, East chip and James at the same time, who is stronger in the second grade? The answer may be dongqiqi.
What was James like in second grade? In 80 regular season games, 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 2.2 steals and 0.7 blocked shots per 42.4 minutes, with a shooting percentage of 47.2%. This allowed James to enter the ranks of All-Star players, the best team also began to write his name, the second year players did so well, not to waste the name of the son of heaven.

-Where is dongqiqiang**
However, dongqiqi does better. From the data, he gets 30.1 points, 10.0 rebounds and 9.2 assists in 33.5 minutes per game. Dongqiqi's skill is more comprehensive. Of course, the air ratio data is meaningless. Dongqiqi is second in the league in MVP, with a per value of 32.2 - the letter brother who got MVP last season, with a per value of 30.9.
In the second year, dongqiqi is better than James, not because of the comparison of this series of data, but because dongqiqi can lead the team to win more, dongqiqi is more able to change the game in this period. Nowitzki was surprised by the performance of dongqiqi. "I think he will experience a difficult transition in the second year of his career, because he performed so well last year and won many triple doubles. **I thought people would start honing him, but dongqiqi got better. * *
The second season is very important for the players. The rookie season won't get too much attention. The second season will test the adaptability and adjustment of the players. This kind of thing shows in Mitchell. However, in the second season, dongqiqi played better and better. Although it was knocked down by the clippers, the overall performance of dongqiqi since the beginning of the season is perfect.

-* why dongqiqi is stronger**
Why does dongqiqi have such a performance?
First of all, dongqiqi's early contact with the professional league has also allowed him to mature ahead of time. Dongqiqi played in the Spanish first division at the age of 16, and he can make progress every year. Before he joined the NBA draft, he was already famous in Europe. James once mentioned that dongqiqi had polished in the professional league as early as possible. "This is the best point of European professional basketball. They started to cultivate their own players very early."
So what we can see is that dongqiqi can adapt to the NBA as soon as possible, and the rookie season has faded away. Compared with the young and mature dongqiqi, it has obviously gone through a longer period of exploration with Trey Yang, who also entered the League at the same time. Dongqiqi defeated Trey Yang last season to win the best rookie honor. Dongqiqi is a great general in the game, which also makes the lone Rangers wake up from years of gloom.

Dongqiqi and Trey young
Secondly, dongqiqi's learning ability is very strong. He can insight into the trend and mainstream of the alliance, and therefore play in the alliance. After entering the league, Dongqi is studying hard. The League encourages players to attack, and Dongqi will play his offensive ability. Dongqiqi is tall and has outstanding consciousness, which makes him able to attack, score and assist his teammates.
Thirdly, the team environment in which dongqiqi is located also helps him a lot, so that he can play his talent to the full. Carlisle gave dongqiqi enough free space and did not tie the genius under the tactical system. Dongqiqi is the most core part of the team's tactics. And dongqiqi is also leading the team with his golfer, which makes dongqiqi show his ability perfectly.
-* conclusion**
Dongqiqi's performance can be called phenomenal existence. The second grade players can play well and regard the team's victory as the most important thing. Of course, this is not to say that Dongqi's career will be more successful than James's, but to some extent, Dongqi will mature earlier after entering the league. In the first two seasons of his career, the European lad East Hickey has performed better than James, but the test for him continues.
