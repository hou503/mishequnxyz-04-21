The Lakers beat the wizards to win 10 consecutive games, ranking first in the league with 17-2 loss in the new season. The whole team is full of joy and joy. Everyone is affected by this atmosphere, trying to show themselves on the court, such a Lakers team has not seen for a long time. "We all get along very well, we often go out together and play together, and our off-site relationship is reflected on the court," McGee said
But the Lakers didn't let up on the game. After beating the wizards, James said, "we have the ambition to win the championship, but that's not what we need to focus on now. At present, we should pay attention to the next opponent, the lone Rangers, who are very strong. We want to keep improving and play at a championship level with a championship mentality every time we step on the court. We have players who have won and they know what to do
The lone rangers are really an excellent opponent. The two teams had a fight in the season. At that time, the Lakers beat the lone Rangers in overtime. However, the referee report confirmed afterwards that Dwight Howard had fouled Seth Curie before Danny green hit the three-point ball in the regular time, and the three-point shooting should be invalid. It was Danny Green's shot that brought the Lakers into overtime.
Fight again, the lone Rangers will undoubtedly want to complete revenge.

Rondo
Dongqiqi was a bit depressed in the first half of the game. He was caught up by the Lakers' defense and the attack efficiency was relatively low.

James
At the end of the game, Deron Wright's three-point hit was the first to score for the lone Rangers, and Justin Jackson's touch was also there. The lone Rangers again took the lead with 20 points. The Lakers tried to narrow the score, but it wasn't good enough. James still had 18 points to go. "Zhan Mei" combo led the team to fight back, but the attack of the lone ranger team was difficult to be stopped, attack after attack.
Dongqiqi hit a three-point goal, the lone Rangers led by 21 points, James got two barely responded. However, such a small amount of money, the Lakers took the lead in changing the main team to admit defeat, the lone Rangers also changed the main players. In the end, there was no more twists and turns in the game. The lone Rangers beat the Lakers 114-100 away, avenging the first game of this season.
The Lakers played fairly well in the first half of the game, but in the third quarter, the game changed dramatically, and the lone Rangers' score difference widened. What are the reasons for the Lakers' failure to recover? First of all, the Lakers' outside shooting is quite sluggish, with only seven shots for 27 shots; second, the Lakers are not energetic enough to cope with the strength of their opponents; third, the Lakers have made too many mistakes, and the team has made 17 mistakes; and the lone Rangers' substitutes have made outstanding performance, which has become a key winning factor in the game.
It's the first time this season to lose more than 10 points. Maybe this is a new beginning.
