When the Clippers played pelicans, the Clippers at home won a big victory unexpectedly. A wave of five home wins was recorded in the Clippers' record book. Leonard and George didn't come up with their best game form, but the two great players on the bench, Luwei and Harrell, played well, which also became the best footnotes of the Clippers' dominance. For the Clippers in running in, defense and team depth are the two magic weapons on which they are based.
In the whole game, he scored 34 points and 12 rebounds in 13 of 18 shots, and Harrell remained a fierce general on the bench. He played extremely hard in the game, and took whatever he wanted in the pelicans. Speaking of the team's performance after the game, Harrell proudly said: "* * we have a good team depth, in any night, players will have three or four guys come out, play a good performance, it's very good." * *

Harrell is tough
How are the two giants of the Clippers doing? Most of Paul George's shots in the whole game are outside the three-point line, 18 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists and 3 steals in 16-for-6 three-point shooting; 7 for 19 shots, 12 free throws and 10 free throws, 26 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists. The Clippers are still trying to rotate and configure their lineup in the third game after the two players joined hands.
It is worth mentioning that Leonard got 12 free throws in 28 minutes.
Is there anything wrong with this? Of course not. It's just easy to think of LeBron James. The last game the Lakers played against the Grizzlies. James hit the basket but didn't get a free throw. James was dissatisfied with the decision in the game. James failed to get a free throw after the game, which became the focus of attention. James even left a familiar reporter to discuss the recent referee's blow.

In an interview in the dressing room, the 30 year old pointed to his bruised arm and told the media: "my whole career is almost like this, especially in recent years. (against the Grizzlies) I made 27 shots, nine of which were three points, but most of the time I focused on the basket. **You can see my left arm. In the last two games, there have been four or five bruises, but the referee didn't call for a foul. * *
In the game with the Grizzlies, James got 30 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists in 14 of 27 shots, and 0 free throws in the whole game.
James has played 16 games this season, averaging 5.6 free throws per game, the lowest in his career - rookies averaging 5.8 free throws per game this season, which is higher than today. Of all the players this season, James is 27th in the field in terms of free throws, roughly equal to Downes and Gallinari. The Lakers got the most free throws from Anthony Davis, with 7.7 free throws per game.

Davis has 27 free throws against the Grizzlies
James complains that he can't get the referee to blow the foul, is it too affectation?
First of all, James's showing the scar on his arm can show some problems, which may not be the evidence of foul, but he repeatedly hit the basket without a foul, is it really the Grizzlies' clean defense? Secondly, although James is one year older this season, he has a good off-season physical maintenance and plays more aggressively in the new season. The goal against the kings is the best proof of James' impact.
"He should get at least eight to 10 free throws per game, there's no doubt about that," Danny Green said in an interview. You can see how he attacks the basket. It's a very confrontational game. Obviously he doesn't know how to perform, so it's hard for the referee to see him fouled. It's something that most people can get, but he doesn't, because he's so big and strong compared to other people. "
Lakers coach Walter Vogel said the Lakers will respond to the league management through appropriate channels.
For an old player, it's a little sad for James to keep hitting the basket and getting 0 free throws.
