In a few days, the NBA will open an important window. Free players who sign new contracts in the summer can be traded. The League will set off a frenzied trade frenzy. Why do you say there may be a trade Frenzy? In the off-season, the teams formed by each team will have an evaluation after a quarter of the competition schedule. The team will change the goal at the beginning of the season according to the actual situation. Reinforcement or deterioration must be achieved through trade.
Of course, trading has never been a simple thing, especially some big trading can only be realized after a long time of planning, especially in the mid season, which is easier than the off-season. Therefore, the opening of the trading window does not mean that the big trade will come suddenly. Many trades can be completed even before the deadline. The trade is a test of the team's patience.

Media Listed top trading players
Whether the deal will happen or not, the media has moved.
Kevin O'Connor, a reporter from the ringer, recently published a report, analyzing the possible "sellers" of teams and hot trading players and so on. In the meantime, Kevin loeffer is again highlighted as one of the players who might change the league. Which team will get Kevin loeffer from the Cavaliers to change the League situation?
The reason why we say "again" is that there is a lot of rumors about Kevin love's transaction recently, and many media have talked about Kevin love's transaction. According to NBC sports, the Cavaliers have put Kevin love on the shelf and are beginning to listen to offers from other teams in the league. To be sure, the Cavaliers are underperforming, which is the main reason why they make the trade decision.

Love and James
Since LeBron James left the Cavaliers, Kevin love has had a good contract extension, but he has been very depressed in the past two seasons. With only 22 games played last season due to injuries and last season's chaos, Loew has no comfortable place in the rebuilding team. This season is back to health, Kevin love in the Cavaliers also find it difficult to play fun.
So if there's a deal, it's good for Kevin love and the Cavaliers.
"It's a reconstruction phase, and it's easy to think about it, especially at this point where we say," Hey, we want to clean up the squad and be young. " I can understand that. But nevertheless, no matter five months or five years, I will return to Cleveland anyway, and I will always love the fans here and become a member of this team in various ways. "

The "three giants" of the Cavaliers in the past
Lefo still has a good sense of rebounding and can open space on the court, but his big contract and state will also make the team eager to get his serious consideration. In a sense, lefo is only suitable to join a playoff team, which is also lefo's own idea. Shams charania reports that Kevin love tends to be traded to a team that can compete for the championship.
A number of teams are linked with loewer, and O'Connor talked about the possibility of the trailblazers trading for loewer. In his opinion, after nurkiki's return, lefo will become the best internal partner of the center. But what kind of chips can the trailblazers offer? McConnell believes Whiteside's expiring contract with batesmere has some allure, and he also mentioned getting Tristan Thompson from the Cavaliers at the same time.

In McConnell's article, he analyzes the benefits of the trailblazers getting Kevin love, which can be used as a partner with the center in the fourth position of the internal line, and can also let him serve as a center in a small lineup. That's not a new idea. That's how Kevin love was used when the Cavaliers were competing for the title. Kevin Loew and nurkiki are also considered to be important weapons against the Lakers. Can the Blazers really become the black horse to challenge the Lakers?
Such trading advice and speculation are totally over idealized ideas.
However, the Blazers do need to make some changes. After signing too many high paid and low-powered players, the team is gradually getting rid of the heavy burden of bad contracts. If we get Kevin love through the trade, it means that the salary space of the team will be locked in the next few years, gambling heavily on the back court double shot and Kevin love's trident lineup. It's a risky approach. Will the trailblazers do it?
