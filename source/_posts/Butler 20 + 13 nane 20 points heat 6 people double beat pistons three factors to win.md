The heat's away trip was not smooth. They won 1-2 in three games against three teams in the West. The difference between winning and losing three games is very big. We can see the ups and downs of the heat's state. Although it is not as eye-catching as it was at the beginning of the season, the record of 6-3 is still good. The heat introduced Jimmy Butler this season, he and the team's running in process is faster, but the absolute strength of the team is not enough.
After the off-season adjustment, the heat's lineup has changed a little. In the new season, the team is playing more overall, and Jimmy Butler has taken the responsibility of the team's core. What's the biggest change for the heat? "That's how our team is built," Spoelstra said before. "In almost every game this season, we have different people who can stand up and contribute."
As the regular season continues, the heat will take on the challenge of the pistons. The pistons are still in a bad start to the season, of course, injury is an important reason. Griffin has just returned from the game, while Reggie Jackson has only played two games. Against the heat, Derek Rose and Blake Griffin will be absent, which will limit the rotation of the pistons.
