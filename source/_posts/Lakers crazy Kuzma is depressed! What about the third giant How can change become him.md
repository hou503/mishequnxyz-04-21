The Lakers ended the game with a crazy offensive show, scoring 142 points without overtime. The Lakers also scored the highest score in 30 years. The last single game scored 142 points without overtime goes back to the 1988-89 season - Elvin Johnson - Oh, the "magician" was still playing for the Lakers.
Since then, the Lakers have scored 142 points twice, but both have played overtime. One was last season, when the Lakers lost to the Spurs in overtime, 142-143. In the past 30 years, the Lakers have scored 141 points in a single game without overtime. In 1990-91, the Lakers beat the Nuggets 141-121, which is also the work of the "magician" era.

The US media have made plans to praise the Lakers
The Lakers attack so crazy, naturally thanks to the combination of "Zhan Mei Group", they are so well matched, the Timberwolves defense was destroyed. "All I have to do is feed him (Davis)," James said after the game. "He stayed efficient all night and played what we expected of him. He can do it in low singles, half baskets and middle backs, so all we have to do is feed him the ball
In addition to the core of the two superstars, the US media also praised another Lakers player after the game. In the pictures released by the US media, Caruso appeared in position C - the US media called James, Davis and Caruso as the "three headed monster". James forwarded the picture and wrote, "bushy brow, best history, best king" and "best history" refers to kaluso.

Alex Caruso
It seems inappropriate to compare Caruso with Davis and James. After all, the influence of Caruso is difficult to match the height of the two superstars, but the important role of Caruso for the team is self-evident. Since the start of the season, in addition to the two star players, the most praised is kaluso, why? One is the organizational function in the reserve team, the other is his defensive ability.
During the offseason, many teams were interested in Caruso, and finally he chose to stay in Los Angeles, which is absolutely worth the money for the Lakers. Of course, it's hard for Caruso to become the "third giant" of the team, but he is an important player in Vogel's tactics. "I can say that Caruso is at a very high level in everything," Vogel said
At this point, maybe one person is more depressed, yes - Kyle Kuzma. Borrowing Song Dandan's lines in the skit, "I can't stand it. If I don't play like this, I've been propagandizing me for half a year. How can I tell old Li that I've accepted all the gifts?" Before the start of the season, Kuzma was regarded as the "third giant" of the Lakers. Although he did become the third scorer of the Lakers, his influence was obviously less than that of kaluso.

Kyle Kuzma
How could Kuzma, who is "handsome and able to play", fail to become the "third giant"? At the beginning of the season, Kuzma missed some games because of injuries. When he returns to the team, he needs to work with the team. What's different from last season is that Kuzma's position in the team has declined a lot. He can't play as he did last season. Playing beside James and Davis, Kuzma needs to adjust himself.
Kuzma's attack ability is good, but it can't be compared with the two star players. When Kuzma doesn't get the ball right, his role in the team's attack will obviously decline. On the other hand, Kuzma is not a good defensive player. The Lakers are full of defenders. Kuzma's shortcomings are easy to show. As a result, Kuzma has suffered a bit in the Lakers' lineup.
Where is "the third giant" so good?
However, it doesn't seem to be hard on Caruso.
