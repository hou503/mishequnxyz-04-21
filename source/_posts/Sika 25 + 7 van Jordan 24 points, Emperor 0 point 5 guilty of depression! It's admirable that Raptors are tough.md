After the start of the new season, the tenacity of the defending champion Raptors is amazing. The departure of Leonard and Danny green, as well as the serious injury tide, did not make the team down. After defeating the eagles on the road, the Raptors are 11-4 this season, so they can rank fourth in the East. Don't underestimate a champion's heart. Toronto's new season is a good illustration of their inner desire.
Of course, we also need to see that the remaining victory of the Raptors is hard work and hard work, but lack of talent and depth, and they suffer losses against stronger opponents, especially against lone Rangers and Clippers. Can we ask the Raptors to do more now? In the hands of Nick NASS, the potential of the squad has been played to the extreme.

Against the 76ers, the Raptors will have six players unable to play because of injuries, including two key players Kyle Lowry and Ibaka who missed multiple games. Matt Thomas was injured against the eagles and added to the injury list. The rotation of the team has become shorter. The 76ers are not easy to deal with, but because last season's playoffs were eliminated by the Raptors, the 76ers obviously want to complete the revenge on the Raptors.
However, at the beginning of the game, the home game of the Raptors gave the 76ers a lower horse power, shooting 8-0 in the outside line. Josh Richardson started in good shape, and the 76ers gradually came into shape. Harris and Horford also hit three points, and the 76ers tied the score.

The 76ers played against the Raptors throughout the game. Although the team's outside shooting was good, it was still difficult to open the score. Such a passive situation is that under the defense of Pau Gasol, ebbed was very depressed and didn't score a point in the whole game. Compared with the Raptors, the 76ers lost an ugly game, and the four consecutive wins were ended.
