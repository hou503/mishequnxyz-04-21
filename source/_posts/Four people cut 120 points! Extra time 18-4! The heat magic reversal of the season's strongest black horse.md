Adebayor defense
As the Youth Division in the East, the performance of the eagles this season is very disappointing. After the start of the season, the light is gradually swallowed up by the dark time. The team loses too much, which also makes the players a little frustrated. Shams charania reports that league sources have revealed that the eagles sometimes suffer from depression, which has led to an emotional scene in the dressing room after their recent defeat, including point guard Trey young.
Before the game against the heat, the eagles only won 2-11 in 13 games, two of which were won recently. The eagles seem to be getting better. They play very hard against the heat. They always have the advantage in the last game. The eagles were six points ahead of the heat until the last minute of the regular season.
However, the next scene is amazing.

Jimmy Butler 
In the last minute, the heat improved the intensity of the game. Duncan Robinson and Jimmy Butler scored three points each, drawing the score in a flash. Both sides had the chance to kill the game in the end, but failed to complete a fatal shot, and the game entered the overtime. What happened in the last minute changed the mentality of both sides. The heat's desire to win suddenly exploded, while the eagles were depressed.
In extra time, the heat played in a fierce way. The blade saw the flesh stabbing the eagles' fragile heart. Duncan Robinson and Adebayor were even more excited. The heat hit a wave of 16-0 offensive climax to take the game directly, and until the last minute of overtime, redish got 4 points for the eagles, which is to save some face. The heat took the lead 18-4 in overtime, and the eagles lost their last strength.

Duncan Robinson
Throughout the game, the heat's four starters played exceptionally well - Duncan Robinson with 34 points, Nan with 36 points, Adebayor with 30 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, Jimmy butler with 20 points, 18 rebounds and 11 assists. Four starters have scored 120 points in total, which is amazing for their outstanding attacking ability. It is also a miracle that two players cut three pairs of data at the same time.
The heat's performance this season is excellent, which can be called the strongest black horse in the league this season. If you want to go further, the heat still have some work to do.
