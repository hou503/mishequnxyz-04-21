Shuai has another son
Nicky, the wife of heat coach Spoelstra, wrote on social media to share his joy of having a son again. "Welcome to the world, Dante Nicholas Spoelstra! Everything is perfect. Thank God for joining us. I can't wait to take him home to meet his best brother and sister! You've been loved by so many people, baby Dante! "
To welcome the birth of the second child, Spoelstra missed the heat's game against Celtic. Assistant coach Dan Craig took up the coach as a temporary substitute, but the heat lost the game by a big score. Of course, Spoelstra doesn't have time to pay attention to many things, he will be immersed in joy for a while, and then he will return to the team to continue his busy work.

Heat another "big three"
As one of the representatives of the young manager in the league, Spoelstra's way to coach the heat is not easy. Spoelstra's father has held the position of general manager in many teams, which has a certain impact on Spoelstra, but he started from the team video coordinator. At the age of 25, Spoelstra accepted a job like the heat and began to serve the heat for a long time.
After that, he worked as assistant coach and scout for the heat. At the end of the 2007-08 season, Pat Riley resigned as head coach, and Spoelstra became Pat Riley's successor. Since then, Spoelstra has been in charge of the heat for 12 seasons, which is not easy in the current league. In the summer of 2010, the heat formed a "big three" lineup, and Spoelstra won two championships in four years when he was at the helm.

Erik Spoelstra 
Although the heat have reached the finals four times in four years and won the championship twice, Spoelstra has not been respected enough. In most people's opinion, Spoelstra did all this only because of his strong lineup, and his coaching ability did not show. Spoelstra has never won the title of best coach in his coaching career, which may be a direct evidence.
In fact, after the disintegration of the "big three" team, the team building work of the heat team has been not good enough until the introduction of Jimmy Butler this season, the team has a star player. The heat have done well this season and are currently fifth in the East 15-6, but they have a long way to go and Spoelstra needs to prove himself.
