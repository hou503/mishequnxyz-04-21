After winning the Texas civil war, the lone Rangers won a wave of five consecutive victories and 11-5 record. For the time being, the lone rangers are in line with the clippers and jazz, ranking third in the West. From last season's failure to play in the playoffs to this season's extraordinary success, it seems to announce that the reconstruction of the lone Rangers team has been basically successful, and the future has become infinitely bright.

"Double handsome" combination
The rise of the lone Rangers started with Luca dongqiqi, who shocked the league in his rookie season, and performed better in the second. How well did dongqiqi perform? According to the latest MVP ranking released by the government, dongqiqi directly entered the top three from the 9th in the previous issue, ranking only behind alphabet brother and James. Dongqiqi, less than 21, is creating his own legendary road.
Dongqiqi is known as the successor of James, which has nothing to do with their overall skills. However, the early performance of James is not as mature as dongqiqi. James also said that when the two men first met, James said: "how many years has he been in professional basketball? Since he was 15? So I don't think this kind of occasion will make him feel stage fright. "

Rick Carlisle 
It's the same thing. Don't have stage fright. The stronger the opponent, the more excited he will be.
Lone Rangers coach Rick Carlisle is full of praise for East chip, it seems that there is no words to praise the young talent. After the team's victory over Spurs, he said: "this guy can do anything he wants on the court. He is playing a magical performance. It's an extraordinary experience to be able to watch and participate in his performance. His teammates and I are just here for fun."
Of course, it's just a joke. Although dongqiqi is very popular, the lone rangers are a team with strong integrity. Of course, dongqiqi is the core role of this team, but the lone Rangers team is not only relying on dongqiqi alone. The overall strength of the lone Rangers team is more important for such outstanding performance, so dongqiqi has a stage to play his personal ability.

Tim Hathaway Jr
In the past three games, the lone Rangers have been very aggressive, scoring 142 points, 143 points and 137 points respectively - yes, let's make it clear that this is a point without overtime. The lone Rangers have fierce outside firepower in these three games. In two of the three games, they hit at least 20 three-point goals. Who can resist the offensive firepower?
Dongqiqi got at least 30 + 6 + 10 data in all three games, and the two games were also clocked out in three quarters. The lone Rangers constantly destroyed their opponents by attacking. The feel of the team is very good. It is worth mentioning that Tim Hadaway has contributed 22.3 points in the past three games. Hathaway was traded from the Knicks and his team status has not been established.

The main force of lone Rangers in the past
After the start of the season, Hathaway has been used as a substitute. When he was put into the starting line in the absence of Seth Curie, he took the opportunity to play extremely well. With Seth Curie back, Hathaway continued to win the starting position, but he scored 31 points in the Texas civil war and became another important helper beside dongqiqi. It's just like little Hardaway said before, "I know my shooting ability hasn't disappeared, but I haven't been able to hit before."
The lone Rangers have been in good shape since the start of the season, but the team has always lacked a stable third scoring point, and portzingis has not recovered to its best. Little Hardaway's career has always been questioned. If he can seize the opportunity to prove himself, it will be more important for him and the lone Rangers. There used to be a combination of Finley, Nash and Nowitzki in the lone Rangers team. Is it going to reappear now?
