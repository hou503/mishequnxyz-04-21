The situation of the warriors in the new season is terrible. The main players are injured one by one, and losing has become a common occurrence. In the past five years, the warriors, who have reached the finals in the last three championships, have experienced the turbulence during the off-season and become the team with the lowest record in the league in the new season, which is really regrettable. In the game against the bulls, though the warriors won, coach Steve Cole was injured.

Cole injured his hand
Steve Cole is a gentle person, his coaching style is more elegant, most of the time the sidelines are smiling. Even if the team is behind, Steve Cole is not impatient and calm, giving people a sense of change. Cole's ability to develop this style has a lot to do with the team's condition when he took over. Cole's rookie season led the warriors to the championship.
In the next five seasons, the warriors have been on the top of the League tower, almost showing the crazy trend of sweeping the league. Leading such a strong team, Steve Cole has the capital to talk and laugh on the sidelines, even if it is backward, the warriors have the ability to reverse opponents. Cole occasionally gets angry. When the team is too lax in the game, Cole usually gets angry to wake up the players' morale.

Cole turns
This time, too.
The warriors wasted the lead in the game, Cole was not satisfied with the defensive attitude of the players called a pause, he angrily broke a tactical board, which made his hand hurt and bleeding. "I didn't see [breaking the tactical board], but I saw his hands bleeding," Spelman recalled after the game. However, he still drew the tactics normally, and then wiped the tactics board with his bloody hand. It's crazy, but I dare not ask him why he's bleeding. "
I believe that at that moment, the warriors players were scared by the anger of the coach, so there was no change in the game. Finally, the warriors beat the bulls and ended their three consecutive defeats. When it comes to breaking the boards after the game, Steve Cole joked: "every season I have a quota to break two boards, today is one of them." Fortunately, Cole is not seriously injured and is unlikely to be absent.

When it happened, many fans commented that "the warriors don't want to win the first place.". For the warriors, due to the long absence of the "water brothers" this season, clay Thompson is not sure whether he can come back this season, it is difficult to play in the playoffs this season. The warriors have come to terms with the fact that Bob Myers has been busy exploring the top picks in 2020, including top contenders Wiseman, lamello Bauer and so on.
Even if that's the case, the warriors can't afford to waste their season, and if they don't, they have to get something. First of all, the warriors should gather their fans. It is not a good thing for the team to disappoint the fans if it is too easy to lose the game. Second, the warriors should prepare for the next season, train the role players in the team, and enrich the team's rotation lineup next season.
Steve Cole's work is too difficult. The problems he hasn't encountered in the past five seasons have all happened this season.
