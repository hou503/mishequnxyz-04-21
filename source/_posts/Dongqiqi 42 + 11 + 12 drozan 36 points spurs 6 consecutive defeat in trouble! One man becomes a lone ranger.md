Losing the game against the Blazers, the Spurs have lost five straight games, the team from the beginning of the season 5-3 down all the way to the third lowest ranking in the West. For the Spurs, it's not a small dilemma at present. During the five consecutive defeats, not all of them are strong opponents, including Grizzlies and magic, whose winning rate is less than 50%. The Spurs last suffered a five game losing streak that dates back to the 2010-11 season.
Although the decision against the Blazers is controversial, the fact that the Spurs are not in good shape is indisputable. When can the Spurs end their losing streak? Will it be the next game against the lone Rangers? The lone rangers are better than the Spurs this season, but in the past five games, they only have 2-3 record. They beat the Raptors on the court, and the lone Rangers stopped the two consecutive defeats.
The "battle of the ox and the horse" once attracted much attention, but with the Mavericks renamed as the lone Rangers, it seems that it no longer exists. Of course, it's not only that, the two teams used to be the strong teams in the league, and every fight between them was also brilliant, but it was the past. The two teams meet again. They all need to fight for victory, especially the Spurs. They need a victory to boost their morale.
