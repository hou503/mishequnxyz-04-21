League player of the week
In fact, it's probably nothing to say, isn't it? However, the name of dinwidi makes the League restless. It doesn't seem to be a problem, but it's a bit different to think of basket tennis player Kyrie Owen. The difference comes from the hearts of fans and the sensitivity of public opinion. Kyrie eurotext didn't start the season smoothly, but when he was injured and absent, everything changed.
Kyrie Owen joined Durant in the basketball net during the off-season, but Durant was absent because of injury, and Owen became the only core of the nets - in theory, after all, Owen is an all-star player. **In his first game for the nets, Owen accepted a 50 + 8 + 7 vote and a one point loss. At that time, no one cared too much, but later he became a clear river. * *

Owen and Durant
Owen's data is good, but the team didn't get very good results. The word "empty cut" plaster is generally applied to Owen. Kyrie Owen has played 11 games for the nets, and the nets have been out of action for five games because of injuries. When Owen was here, he won 4-7 in 11 games, 4-1 in five games when Owen was not there, and the team achieved 50% of the winning rate of 8-8.
Rumors broke out at this time, the question of Owen has never stopped, last season has been like a flood, now another flash flood. For Kyrie Owen, the reality is callous and inexplicably embarrassing. If he can't lead the team to win, he will be hard to get rid of the fate of being questioned. Although professional players have long been used to this, but the pressure of public opinion is like a mountain in Owen's heart.

Perkins's mouth is open
Kendrick Perkins is definitely the most outspoken of the many doubting voices. He believes that Kyrie Owen's injury is intended to avoid the away game with Celtic. "Owen looked at the schedule before the start of the season and then 'planned' the injury," he wrote on social media. He doesn't want to go back to Boston next week, he doesn't want to be sprayed there. "Ah!"
The cruelty of the professional league has never changed, nor has the rule of winning or losing. Players can prove that their place is the field of play, winning the world is beautiful, and losing too many games is dangerous everywhere. Look at the league's admiration for Luca Dongqi and its criticism of Kyrie Owen, and the rules of the league are clearly displayed.

Kyrie Irving 
It's not fair for Owen.
First of all, Kyrie Owen is in a running in period with the basketball team. When he is away, the basketball players are more familiar with him, which is the fundamental reason why the basketball team has performed better recently. Nets coach Atkins said: "I would say this: I think Spencer dinwicky and these people, they have been in this team for many years. It's a big difference when you have a lot of new people. I think Owen is still learning what we are doing. **Owen needs time to fully understand what we're doing, both on the offensive and on the defensive. * *
Second, the recent schedule of the nets is easier, with four wins in five games, and the bulls, the Knicks, the Hornets and the kings defeated by the nets. In the three straight defeats before Owen's injury, the nets faced the Suns, jazz and nuggets. And three games are away games, and the recent five games are three main and two guest.

Ding Wei Di
When the outside world questioned Owen's attitude and communication with his teammates, Atkinson responded decisively. He even gave Kyrie Owen an "a +" rating after joining the nets. Owen needs some support at this time, Atkinson said of Owen's absence, supporting him: "without Owen, we are not better. That's the truth. "
Owen is facing another period of darkness and he needs to be strong.
