In the Lakers' game against the magic, there was a fierce conflict during the game. Dudley and Evan Du were both expelled. The clash was sparked by Howard, who was fouled by an opponent in a layup, and then some pushing. Dudley saw the conflict quickly run to the place where it happened, and he was directly expelled by the referee because of the intensified conflict.

Conflict on the field
Dudley was expelled, but teammate Davis complained for him after the game, "he shouldn't be expelled, he stood up for Howard, his behavior is representative, very consistent with the team concept we want to establish - that is, no matter what happens in the game, the players should always support each other. Dudley is standing up for his brother. "
It's just the team's own business. Dudley's behavior on the court is too extreme and his expulsion is not incomprehensible.
Speaking of his expulsion after the game, Dudley said: "sometimes there is a smell of gunpowder in the game. Dwight (Howard) has been confronted with some improper physical confrontation. But I don't care if my teammates are wrong, it's like you protect your son. If they are in trouble, you will stand up for them, whether or not the teacher is aimed at him, because that is my son. Dwight is my teammate and I see it as the same thing

Dudley always does
Dudley has never won any honors in the NBA. What impresses people most is his fiery temper. He is not only a fearless player, but also a player in the game sometimes. On the other hand, Dudley is also the type of player that the championship team likes. His game experience can bring changes to the team at some time. In this game against the magic, Isaac performed quite well, but was expelled with him.
After joining the Lakers in the offseason, Dudley was clear about his position. In an interview, Dudley once said with a smile, "I will protect the two of them (James and Davis), even if they get malicious fouls, I will not hesitate. Old Zhan only needs to pay me a fine of 20000 dollars. I won't allow anyone to touch LeBron (James) and Davis, that's part of my job. "
Because of such comments, Dudley was ridiculed as "bodyguard" by fans.
Dudley did what he said, and this game gave his teammates a good protection.

Dudley training
What's more, Dudley has never been a good scorer. He's like a happy guy for the Lakers. During the off-season, choosing the number of jerseys contracts the laughingstock for the whole summer. After joining the Lakers, Dudley has become one of the players that the fans pay close attention to, and Dudley has gained many fans on social media.
However, if you think the Lakers are just signing "bodyguards" or "mascots", it's wrong. Dudley is not only a topic character, he can play a role on the court. Although the game was expelled from the field, but before being expelled played 21 minutes game, three-point four shot three, contributed 9 points and 2 rebounds for the Lakers, plus or minus + 16 is the highest in the whole team.
Dudley doesn't play much time, but give him time to get something. This season, three-point goals totaled 8-for-12, with a hit rate of 67%. It's true that Dudley's low playing time and low shooting times lead to a small sample, but it's true that Dudley has a good outside touch. The Lakers don't see Dudley as a regular weapon, but when the game gets stuck, he may be the X factor that changes the game.
