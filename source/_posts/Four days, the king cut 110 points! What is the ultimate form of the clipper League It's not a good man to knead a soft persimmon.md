The Clippers lost to the Spurs in the game, which caused a heated discussion in the media after the game. What's more, Leonard and Paul George's combination is not as good as they think. Their two giants combination just looks beautiful. The Clippers don't need to argue, because the next game against the Wizards ushered in a big win, the outside view of the Clippers has become completely different.

What happened against the Wizards? The Clippers scored 39 points in the first quarter - yes, the Wizards also scored 35 points, but when the Clippers scored another 43 points in the second quarter, the wizards were a bit overwhelmed. The Clippers scored 82 points in half-time, 25 points ahead of the Wizards. The Clippers scored 150 points and beat the Wizards by 25 points.
The Clippers didn't score 150 points in a single game this season, the last against the eagles, which beat the eagles by 49 points. It's different from the game against the eagles, but once again with 150 points, the Clippers' lineup is relatively complete - Paul George and Leonard are all out, this is the Clippers' routine.

As we all know, when the Clippers set up their current lineup during the off-season, this team was branded with "horror". The Clippers are believed to dominate the league, largely because of Leonard and Paul George's personal ability, as well as their two superstars, while retaining two backup fierce players, Luwei and Harrell. This team has "four kings".
How powerful can the "Four Heavenly Kings" be? The game against the Wizards gave the answer, with four men scoring 110 points together.
Is this the ultimate form for the Clippers to dominate the league? Of course, it's too early. What the Clippers met was an unguarded team of wizards. They just met a soft persimmon. The Clippers are still in a state of running in, the team still has a lot of things to do, Leonard also said, "we are still improving, sometimes the attack will stagnate, so we will do more shooting exercises before the game to solve this problem."

Kawhi Leonard 
At this point in the season, there is no way to have a fair assessment of the Clippers. It doesn't have to be questioned because the Clippers are in the doldrums, or boasted because the Clippers are in the high light. It still needs time to prove. George said: "we all have different attacking styles. We all played the core of the team's attack. Now we have to learn how to play around each other. We have different roles and we have a lot of work to do."
So, wait and see.
