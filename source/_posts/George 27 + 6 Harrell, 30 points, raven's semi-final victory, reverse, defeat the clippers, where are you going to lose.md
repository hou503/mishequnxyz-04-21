The Clippers beat Timberwolves on the road. In the last five away games, they won 4-1, leaving the last one. In the game against Timberwolves, the Clippers showed the horror of the double giant team to the whole league. Although it was an atypical clippers game, the two men relied on their outstanding personal ability to score 88 points and win the game.
The reason why such a game can be played is directly related to the absence of many players in the team. With the absence of Beverly and Ludwig, the operation of the team is not smooth. "We know we have to stand up and play aggressively, which is the key to our win in the absence of many players because of injuries," George said after the game. Early play aggressive, in the beginning to establish an advantage
However, this is not the most difficult situation for the Clippers. In the Clippers' away game against the bulls, Beverly and Ludwig continue to be absent, while Cowie Leonard is off again. The good news is that shamet has recovered from his injury against the Raptors last month and missed the Clippers for half a month. He is back on the court at this time and can help the Clippers a lot.
