The game between clippers and bucks is regarded as "the preview of the finals" by the media. Although this statement is a little exaggerated, it can see the super strength of the two teams this season. When it comes to the Bucks before the game, clipper manager rivers thinks the bucks are the best team in the East. The Bucks have won 13 games in a row, and the Clippers will be the best match to test their real strength.

After the start of the game, both sides play steadily at the defensive end, shooting efficiency is very low. Three and a half minutes after the game, the two sides only played 2-2 score, huge defensive strength from the beginning of the game showed. Bucks rely more on outside shooting, but after the start of several people's outside shooting failed to hit, Bucks once seemed more passive.
However, after the Bucks' rotation adjustment, the backup team's outside shooting opened up the situation, and the Clippers also paid a big price. Connaughton led the bucks in the three-point rain, and the Bucks took the upper hand in the game in an instant, while the Clippers' attack fell into a stagnant situation. Under the Bucks' shrinking defensive strategy, the clippers, who can't shoot outside, are struggling.

At the end of the first quarter, Bucks led the Clippers 30-15, and the Clippers played their worst single quarter game of the season. For a team with "four King Kong" configuration, this is unimaginable, so it is not difficult to see how well the Bucks defense. In the first quarter of the game, the Bucks shot 6 of 14 3-pointers, and the excellent outside firepower also ensured the team's offensive firepower output.
However, in the second quarter, the game changed. The Clippers found the feeling of shooting outside, which punished the Bucks' defensive strategy to a certain extent. The clippers were able to narrow the difference in the second quarter. The Bucks' team defense was very difficult. Leonard made three mistakes in the half-time game. However, in the second quarter, the Clippers won 6 points in a single quarter. At the end of the first half, the clippers were 43-52 behind the bucks.

Both teams are the top teams in the league. They have strong execution in the game, and they can find the opponent's loopholes in defense. In the first quarter, the Bucks relied on defense to establish an advantage, and the Clippers did a good job in the second quarter, not allowing the bucks to fire on the outside at will, which also inhibited the Bucks' scoring. There's a bit of playoff in the strong talk, and it's not clear who's going to win.
