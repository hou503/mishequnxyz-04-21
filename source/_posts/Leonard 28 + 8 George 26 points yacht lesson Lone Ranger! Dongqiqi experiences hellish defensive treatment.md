The Clippers beat the pelicans to win 5 straight home games, ending this period of home games, and will go away to play against the three Western teams. The first away opponent of the clippers is the hot lone Rangers. In the past three games, the lone Rangers have scored at least 137 points in each game. The attack power is very fierce. And can achieve three consecutive games to get at least 137 points, the last team or Phoenix Suns.
The popularity of the lone Rangers is directly related to dongqiqi's excellent performance. The young second grader has a big break in the new season, with an average of 30.6 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.8 assists. When the Clippers manager was away from home, he talked about dongqiqi. "He is not young. I think he is 40 years old. He plays so well that he can't be the age they say he is."
The match between the lone Rangers and the clippers is a great opportunity for the lone rangers to test the team's quality. The Clippers superstars Leonard and George have played three games together. Although they haven't reached the best match, the depth of the Clippers' lineup is amazing. Compared with the clippers, the lone Rangers don't have much starting point for attack. What will dongqiqi, who is called "snake head" by Leonard and George, do in the game?

Patrick Beverley 

Dongqiqi's attack was blocked after the opening, and the break after the suspension resulted in two fouls and two penalties. He scored for the first time in this game. Zubates scored two points in attack, Powell responded with a three-point goal, and both sides gradually entered into a state of attack. Dongqiqi made a good throw, the lone Rangers equalised, and Paul George hit another three-point goal. Bolzingis got two free throws and zubates got two fouls. The clippers were four points ahead.
Little Hadaway scored 6 points in a row, and the lone Rangers surpassed the score. However, Paul George beat the lone Rangers in a row, scoring for the Clippers continuously, helping the Clippers to lead the lone Rangers by 7 points. The Mavericks had four free throws in a row to narrow the gap, while Jamie green and Dewey scored three points in a row in the last minute. At the end of the first quarter, the clippers were 34-27 ahead of the Mavericks.

McGrady actively grabbed the rebound and scored. The Clippers continued to score at the beginning of the second quarter and took the opportunity to score 5-0. The Clippers quickly extended the difference to 12 points, and the rotation of the lone Rangers team fell behind. Compared with the rotation of the clippers, the second lineup of the lone Rangers has two problems. Leonard took the team to the start of the second quarter after the break of the first quarter, which made the lone Rangers a little uncomfortable.
Back to the game, Seth Curie hit a three-point goal, breaking the lone Rangers' scoring shortage in the second quarter. However, the Clippers' offensive tide was not interrupted, and a wave of 9-2 continued to expand the difference. Only Seth Curie scored in this period of time. Dongqiqi and polzingis were replaced, and the lone Rangers were gradually reducing the difference. Dongqiqi got two penalties, and the difference was once reduced to 10 points.
However, the clippers have more powerful attacking points, and Dewey is attacking. Green and Leonard continue to score in the attack, and the difference is widened to 17 points. Polzingis made two free throws and one middle for the lone Rangers. Leonard hit a three-point goal, while polzingis magically hit an extra three points. At the end of the first half, the clippers were 62-46 ahead of the lone Rangers by 16 points.

Kawhi Leonard 
Polzingis hit a three-point goal in the third quarter of the game, but zubates played 2 + 1 to give a response. Polzingis attacked again and won, and the lone ranger team struggled to catch up with the score. However, the strength of the lone Rangers' defense is not enough to prevent the Clippers from scoring at the offensive end. Zubates has been successful in attacking under the basket, and the difference has been widened to 20 points. In a passive situation, the lone Rangers had to call a timeout.
Back in the game, the lone Rangers replaced Barea and added a holding point in addition to Dongqi. The lone Rangers also strengthened their defense. Barea hit a three-point goal, and the lone Rangers were still 16 points behind. Leonard scored four points in a row, Hadaway changed his attack and layup, and the Clippers called a timeout. Back in the game, Paul George led the way, and Dongqi played 2 + 1.
The cooperation between Luwei and Harrell on the field is very threatening. The defense of the lone Rangers is flawed, and the Clippers split the attack of the lone Rangers, which makes the situation on the field more unfavorable to the lone Rangers. Harrell's attack was successful. The clippers were 22 points ahead, and Seth Curie and Barea each scored three points. Harrell scored two more points, and Barea responded with a shot. At the end of the three quarters, the clippers were 93-77 ahead of the lone Rangers.

At the beginning of the last game, the lone Rangers were struggling under the defense of the Clippers. The clippers were 4-0, 20 points ahead of the lone Rangers. In the case of more backwardness, the lone Rangers did not replace the main players, while the Clippers still let Leonard lead the team. Powell was successful in attacking under the basket, and the lone Rangers were close to the point difference, while Leonard made three penalties and three strikes for a foul, and the Clippers stabilized the situation.
Bronson and Wright attack each well. The lone rangers are 14 points behind. The Clippers' leading edge is constantly eroded. After half a game, the lone Rangers replaced the core players, but by this time, the lone Rangers were 18 points behind. The leading advantage is huge. The Clippers change the main team in advance, and the lone Rangers change the main pitches to admit defeat. At the end of the game, the Clippers beat the lone Rangers 114-99.
Although the attack of lone Rangers is very popular recently, the attack power of lone Rangers is obviously limited in the face of the top defensive lineup of clippers. The Clippers held on to East Hickey. Beverly, Paul George and Leonard took turns defending. East Hickey enjoyed a hellish suffocating defense. Compared with the top strength of the clippers, the gap between the lone Rangers is very obvious.
