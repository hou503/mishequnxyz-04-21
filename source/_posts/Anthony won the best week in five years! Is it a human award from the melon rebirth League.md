Anthony won the best of the week
Carmelo Anthony is undoubtedly the hottest topic in the past time. The trailblazers have offered him a contract to return to the league. Anthony's performance is getting better and better. He is also the "melon" that people expect. **Anthony has gone through the darkest part of his life from being cut off by the bulls to being a master again. Now he is finally blooming again, with the smile on his face. * *

Anthony back on the court
After a few games of maladjustment before returning to the court, Cameron Anthony found the feeling of the game. In the past three games, he got 22.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 0.7 steals. With three excellent and stable performances, Anthony was elected the best player in the west last week, which was not easy for him - the last time he won the best player of the week was on March 10, 2014.
Is it far enough? More than five years ago, Carmelo Anthony was the face of New York City. He was branded as an all-star player. At that time, Jr Smith never thought he would win the championship in the future. At that time, Stoudemire was facing the Yellow faint of NBA career. At that time, little Tim Hadaway just started his career**
At the same time, the names of baniani, Shannon Brown, prignoni, Felton and so on played the fate symphony of the Knicks.

Anthony plays for the Knicks
Time flies in New York's infatuation. Before he can feel the taste of happiness, Anthony goes on a journey of vagrancy. Leaving New York did not allow him to find the ideal habitat. Being traded, laid off and abandoned, Anthony's path became narrower and narrower. At last, Anthony suddenly found that the darkness was waiting for him. He could not see the edge of the darkness at a glance. He walked desperately until a light broke through the darkness.
**Feel pain in a good time, feel good in a bad time. * *
Anthony talked about his heart for a year. He was like a tired traveler coming out of the desert. Anthony said: "at that time, I began to ask myself, 'why? What is going on? What did I do wrong? Can I still play NBA? " I began to question myself and doubt myself. It took me a while to get out of this mindset, and it took a lot of time to think about it. "

Media production apology application form
**Anthony came back, with doubts and blessings from the outside world, and stood on the field in the age of experience. After a short adjustment, he found the time lost in the past two or three years. In the cheers of the Bulls players, Anthony went back to the young age of fresh clothes; in the eyes of the whole league turning to goodwill, Anthony took off the hard armor in his heart. * *
Everything is brightening up again.
"Anything that can't destroy you will make you stronger." this sentence is suitable for Anthony. Anthony walked through the confusion in his life and stood proudly in the flowers. Zhou best is the best recognition of him, although it is accompanied by some questions - whether the league is awarding the human relationship award, but when you see Anthony's change, when you see the trailblazers come out of the mud, the answer naturally appears in your heart.

The media are ready to apologize to Anthony. The taunts, criticisms, insults and white eyes that Anthony once endured are beaten to the core by his own performance. The US media even made an "apology application form" to apologize for being unfriendly to Anthony. At the end of the form, it said: "here, I will show my respect for Anthony, and I will not degrade a future Hall of Fame member."
The happiest thing in life is to let the opponents shut their mouths in front of reality.
Of course, Anthony won't care about it any more. If he does, how could he be reborn? He doesn't care about the eyes of the outside world, only whether he can do his best, how his career can continue, how to get along with his teammates better. **Maybe it's not the best Anthony, maybe it's the best Anthony, but just remember - he has defeated the outside world. * *
**That's enough. * *
