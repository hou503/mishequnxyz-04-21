The Lakers against the Nuggets, away from the purple gold team into a faster state, but the overall stronger nuggets or gradually back to rhythm. At the end of the first quarter, the score was close, and Rajan Rondo hit a three-point goal, which gave the Lakers a four point lead at the end of the first quarter. In the first part of the second quarter, Malik Bisley continued to chase points, and the difference was only two points.
At this time, Danny green missed a three-point shot from the bottom corner. When Howard was ready to grab the backboard, a dark shadow rose from Howard's side and smashed the ball into the basket with one arm catch-up. Looking back, the popularity of dunking was as calm as if nothing had happened, but the team-mates were excited by the surprise of mending the dunk. The man's hair was sparse and his face was a little old-fashioned, and he was called "bald Mamba" Alex Caruso.

Kaluso's amazing make-up button
Caruso has a face that doesn't match his performance. He looks like a steady ball controller and organizer. It's hard to connect him with the talent explosion. This is also the reason why Caruso always does something unexpected. In fact, Caruso has excellent physical fitness. There are often fantastic dunks on the court, which are ridiculed by the fans as "going in 'bald' is a dunk".
This is not the first time that carrousel's make-up has become a hot topic. Last season, the Lakers played against the warriors, and the make-up of Carrousel shocked the Lakers. At that time, Caruso jumped up against Durant, who was competing for the rebounds, and buckled the ball into the basket beside Durant. James, who was absent from the game, was stunned on the sidelines. Although dunking is common to James, it's exciting to see Caruso dunk.

James and Caruso
"The interesting thing is that that dunk is the perfect combination of warriors background and LeBron reaction," said Caruso. Maybe no one will notice how bad I was playing. I remember that I was 6-for-0. We were much behind, but no one remembers that
James is really "never seen the world", Caruso this time let him see cool on the court.
Speaking of the beautiful touch up, Caruso said: "it's mainly luck. I stand on the track of the ball. I saw Dwight (Howard) carry all the people behind him alone, leaving an empty route. When the ball flies to the basket, I will track it. After playing basketball for so many years since childhood, you will know the rule of the ball popping out of the basket. So I saw that it might hit the front of the basket, and then play directly to my side, so I took off to get enough, and it was a success. "

Alex Caruso
Most of the time, Caruso is more down-to-earth. He is a qualified organizer and excellent defender. From a player with only one two-way contract in the League to a player who can stand in the league, Caruso's career is inspirational enough. Last season in the Lakers have a good performance, off-season as many as 12 teams interested in him, and eventually Caruso stayed with the Lakers.
In fact, it's a wise decision for the Lakers to keep Caruso.
Vogel is very appreciative of Caruso. He once said, "Caruso is a star defender. I think his defense is elite. If you've studied him on video, or seen his performance in summer league training, you won't be surprised at his performance this season. Caruso has great footwork and height. **Caruso also has a very keen sense of the pitch, which is his greatest advantage. * *
Obviously, Vogel made it clear.
