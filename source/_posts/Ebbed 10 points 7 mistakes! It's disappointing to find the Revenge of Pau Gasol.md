Enrique, who missed the Cavaliers game with a bruised left hip, is back in the 76ers' starting line-up against the Raptors. As for Joel OBID's truce, whether it's just because of injury is controversial. When OBID last played Pau Gasol, he didn't score a point in 11-0. For the first time in his career, ebbed, who has lost his face, is this time waiting for revenge?
"We all know that ebbed will be back in this game, and we won't be surprised if he can play what people expect him to do in this game," Brent Bronx said of the match. However, he is a good center in this game, and he (Mark Gasol) always plays well against the 76ers, whether in the Grizzlies or the Raptors

Pau Gasol is the star of enbidk
Ebbed's career so far, he and mark Gasol before the game a total of 13 games, including 6 regular season, 7 playoffs. In the 13 games, ebbed can only contribute 14.8 points and 10.5 rebounds - maybe the two pairs of figures can be said, but ebbed's hit rate is only 33.5%, and there are 4.2 mistakes per game.
Of course, this doesn't mean that Pau Gasol is a good player. In fact, Pau Gasol is not easy. 13 times against Joel nbid, Pau Gasol can only contribute 11.2 points and 5.9 rebounds, shooting only 37.9%. However, for MARC Gasol, his task most of the time is to guard against ebbed, as long as the consumption of ebbed is successful, which is also the reason why little Gasol is superior against ebbed.

However, Enrique was still disappointing. He didn't show his personal ability in front of Gasol. Although ebbed was better than the last time, he only made 3-for-7 shots, 10 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists in the game, but made up to 7 mistakes. Of course, Pau Gasol's data is a bit more confusing, he didn't score a point in 6-0 shots, and he was punished five times for personal fouls.
Feng Shui turns around in turn. Last time, ebbed didn't get a point. This time, it was little Gasol's turn. But is this the result of ebbed? Pau Gasol didn't make many shots in the attack, and most of them focused on the outside shooting. In the attack of the Raptors, he was totally dependent on his hands. Pau Gasol's shooting percentage this season is very low. In this game, four of the six shots were missed from the outside.

Pau Gasol defense
Although the game did not score a point, but little Gasol's defense is good, the game plus and minus value + 9 is the highest in the team. Pau Gasol, who has been playing as a framer and inner line barrier this season, has played a good defense since the start of the new season for the Raptors. But for the understanding of the playing habits of ebbed, makes little Gasol in the defense against ebbed.
This time, however, the other members of the 76ers performed well, while the main player of the Raptors fan fulit withdrew from the game due to injury. The 76ers finally beat the Raptors, relying on the leading edge established in the first three quarters. The two teams each won at home. Their match of this season is not over. The story of ebbed and Gasol is still going on. The next match between the two sides will be by the end of January 2020, and the match is still expected.
