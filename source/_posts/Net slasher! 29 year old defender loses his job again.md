NBA official website news
According to NBA official website, Brooklyn basketball net team cut guard Iman champert. On November 13, us time, the nets announced the signing of Iman shampoo, who played 13 games for the nets, averaging 4.2 points and 2.6 rebounds in 18.5 minutes. In the home win over Celtic, Iman Champlain scored 9 points from 4-for-8 shots, leaving him with the highest score in a single game for the nets.
Why did the nets cut Iman champert a month after signing him? Before the start of the season, Wilson Chandler was banned for 25 games because of a positive doping test, and the nets were allowed to add another player to the 15. The nets signed Iman champert for the rotation of the lineup, and the fans once hoped that the nets could sign Cameron Anthony, who was at home at that time.

Iman champert's career has been high and low. He was once a highly respected defense player in the league. He was in good shape when he played for the Knicks. Later, the Cavaliers, who were competing for the title, took care of it and went to the Cavaliers together with their teammate Jr Smith. However, some accidents happened that Jr Smith won the main position in the event of champert's injury. This did not affect the "money" path of champert, who received a contract of ten million a year in the Cavaliers.
During his time in Cleveland, Champaign won a championship ring, but there was a major turning point in his career. In the 2017-18 season, he played only 14 games due to injury. By the summer of 2018, his expired contract was traded continuously, while the state of champaign was seriously declining in the displacement. The 17th place of the first round of 2011 was selected, but it failed to meet people's expectations.

Champert for the Cavaliers
In fact, at the age of 29, his career should have been in a golden period, and he should have a better condition. Among the players with him in the 2011 draft, Kyrie Owen, clay Thompson, kenba Walker and Coway Leonard are also the backbone of the league. Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris are also important players of their respective teams.
Iman champaign was confused at this time, and left without a bright career.
Although 3D players are very popular in the league, but shambaud is now generally defensive, three-point shot in a mess, it is difficult to get too much trust in the league. When he played for the kings in the first half of last season, he was able to show the value of his family, but it was like a flash back. At the age of 29, when she lost her job again, could she wait for the next chance?

Wilson Chandler 
The nets cut champert because Wilson Chandler is about to return and is banned from 25 games by the league. He will be released before the game against the 76ers. After playing in CBA League for a short time, Wilson Chandler, who was ridiculed as "CBA star" by fans, also drifted away after leaving nuggets. He was traded to the 76ers last season, and then to the Clippers in the middle of the season, and his form fell.
Wilson Chandler is about to start his 12th season of his career. In this competitive league, playing for such a long time is not easy. Some people come, some cry and some laugh. The competitive environment of the league is well reflected in Iman champert and Wilson Chandler. Hard work is the foundation of everyone's foothold, and everyone may lose the opportunity because of his slackness.
