Kuzma said of the doubt: "is there anyone else we haven't played? We have played away games, both home and away, the lone Rangers, the Spurs are not easy to play away. The heat are the top three teams in the East, anyway. Because we're the Lakers, everyone wants to talk to you. We like it, we've heard it, but we're only going to do a good job of winning. "
Back at home, the Lakers play the Timberwolves. Although the Timberwolves are still the top eight teams in the west, their record is not good enough. The winning rate of 10-11 is less than 50%. In the last three games, the Timberwolves have all lost. The team is under a lot of pressure. Can they make any noise at home? And the goal of the Lakers is very simple, that is to continue the good situation of the team.
