Leonard returns to Toronto to face the old owners, and he will receive his own championship ring before the game. The Raptors have challenged the Clippers in Los Angeles before this season, but they will not send "express delivery" to Leonard in that game, and Leonard's championship ring needs to be "taken by himself". Although he only played for the Raptors for one season, he led the team to win the first championship in the team's history.

Raptors champion
Even if Leonard left the Raptors, the break-up between the two sides during the off-season was a little unpleasant, but the Raptors still gave Leonard a very high treatment. In a sense, Leonard's history with the Raptors is great enough to play a decisive role in winning the title. Perhaps it was out of gratitude that the Raptors held a special ceremony for Leonard, which made the team feel extremely warm.
For this important ceremony, the Raptors asked the fans to arrive at the scene 15 minutes in advance. The team did a lot of work for Leonard's championship ceremony. It was the first time to show a video of Leonard on the spot. In the review of last season, it seems that Leonard is back to the golden iron horse of last season. Every bit of Leonard's team is concentrated in the video, like a micro film with huge tension.

Get the championship ring
What's more surprising is that the Raptors also arranged a classic part of the scene - the combination of lighting and video, which restored Leonard's classic victory against the 76ers, which is the most crucial goal for the team to win the championship. The whole stadium turned off the lights. In the dark stadium, the fans watched the center of the stadium. After the ball was thrown, they bounced on the basket for four times. Now they can still feel the excitement.
At the end of the video, Leonard hugged the team's staff and the Raptors, and Lori handed Leonard the championship ring. Leonard tried to put the ring on his hand. After failing, he held the ring in his hand, and the championship ring ceremony ended. Although the game will be a fight after that, the time before that belongs to Leonard.

Classic last season
"I think there will be some cheers for me, but I think there will be more boos because they want to win," Leonard said of the Raptors fans before the game. They don't cheer for their opponents. Their performance last season was unbelievable and they have been with the team as we go through the ups and downs Leonard finally thanked the fans.
In the on-site championship ring, the fans cheered Leonard and even shouted "MVP" in unison.
The scene was warm and moving.
