After the start of the new season, the only team in the league that remains unbeaten is the 76ers, who won four consecutive games after the start.
During the off-season, the 76ers lost two important players in the lineup, Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick. However, the 76ers who aspired to win the championship still strengthened the lineup. The joining of Josh Richardson and Al Horford made the 76ers still attract much attention. Sure enough, the new team of the 76ers did well. After beating Celtic in the opening game, they went on their way to win.
However, when the 76ers were in good shape, embid fought against Downes in the game against Timberwolves, not only being expelled on the spot, but also being banned for two games by the league. The 76ers are about to start their journey to the West. Will they be able to leave in four away games? The good news is that the Blazers are suffering from a series of internal injuries, which will offset the loss caused by the absence of embid to some extent.
The Blazers are 3-2 at the start. Although the record is not very good, the team is in good shape. The starters of the trailblazers have strong competitiveness, but the team's backup team has not performed well. That's what happened to the Blazers last season. They still need to improve their reserves this season, which will determine the Blazers' cap.
