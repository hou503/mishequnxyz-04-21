**How far is it from heaven to hell? The answer from the warriors may be "a moment". * *
The warriors injured Durant in the playoffs last season, but the team was still able to fight the Raptors in the finals, and clay Thompson was also injured, which made the fire of hope go out in the empty Oracle arena. After all, it has become a sad past, but when the off-season comes, it is found that the team has entered into the unpredictable environment. Is it so easy to start over when igodara is traded, Livingston is retired, Russell and role players are involved?
Of course not, and much harder than expected.
At the beginning of the new season, all kinds of unexpected things happened to the warriors, which made the team moved to the new stadium only smile. Before the start of the game, Steve Cole was still lamenting that there were so many injuries that he felt incredible. **Stephen Curry's injury suddenly came, and the warriors suddenly fell into the ice cave. Leng intended that this team, which won three championships in the past five years, would flow, like being thrown into a piece of ice from the neck. * *

Greene was blown
Then Drummond green was injured and there was a small problem with diangiro Russell.
When these players fell one by one, the warriors' squad was as bleak as the Chinese men's team was placed in the European Cup. Russell's injury was not serious. He took the lead in recovering and returned to the field. In the first game, he played 52 points in a single game. Then Drummond - Green also returned to the court, waiting for him is not a good performance, but the embarrassing result of being expelled by the referee.
In the first quarter, the warriors were able to cope with the game against the West's strong rivals, and the gap in the second quarter was reflected. In the first half of the match, green was killed by his opponent. In the third quarter, green was blown two technical fouls in succession - not satisfied with the referee's blow, yelled at the referee, the referee gave him two technical fouls in succession, and green was expelled.
After the game, Drummond green was still angry. When talking about the deportation, he told the media: * * "I don't agree with the sentence, and I won't accept another adult telling me" don't talk. ". You can judge whether it is right or wrong subjectively, but you can't help me to speak. I am an adult and also a father, which is the cause of all this. " * *

Green has always been passionate
Drummond Green's career has been boasted of too many technical fouls, and he can be called the "king of technical fouls" in active service. In the course of five years and three championships of the warriors, green is known as the "Great Gate" of the warriors and an indispensable core player. Green is passionate on the court and can always activate his teammates when the team is in silence. Therefore, the grumpy Drummond green is trusted by Steve Cole.
Against the jazz, Drummond green was expelled. Cole also expressed his support for his disciples after the game. "I think it's a very difficult decision. Personally, it's an offensive foul. The referee finally made the opposite decision. I don't know what Green said. We really need him. One technical foul is OK, but we can't have two technical fouls. "
Drummond green was expelled in the first battle of his comeback. His luck was really bad, but what was more worrying was his condition. After the start of the new season, Drummond green was in a bad state, averaging 8.5 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists, shooting only 40.8%. What's worse, Drummond Green's influence on the defensive side is still weakening, and the warriors need to rebuild their defense system.

Green and Cole
As clay Thompson and Stephen curry are both recovering from injuries, Drummond green should have played a greater role in the game, but the core value of green has not been shown. Green has been controversial in the team's five years and three championships. Many people believe that green is just a system player. It's hard to become an all-star player without the warriors. Even green has been caught up in trade rumors.
The warriors didn't trade for Drummond green, and they extended his contract early in the off-season. However, in the worst situation of the team, the rumors of trading green are once again rampant. It seems easy to understand that green is no longer as important as he used to be in this Warriors team, especially when he is likely to give up this season, it is difficult for green to give the team too much help.
Trading Green is not a quick decision. The warriors need to think about it in the long run. After all, green and the "water brothers" have been successful.
Green is clearly aware of the situation he is facing, and he is also adjusting his state. He said: "I need to find my own style, and I promise that I will soon find the state and reactivate our attack. At present, the team has a new team. I don't know if you have noticed it. We lack a normal attack system. The team needs great adjustment. I also need adjustment. "
This is a critical moment for green and the future of the warriors.
