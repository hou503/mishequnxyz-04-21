The Lakers finished the trip happily with three wins in a row. The happy atmosphere of the team was constantly flowing with the air on the court, and everyone in the team showed their best condition. Everyone on the court is very hard, as far as possible to make their own contribution to the team, the cohesion between the players let the Lakers full of strength. But the heart of the team is still the "Jamie" combination, they control the fate of the team.

Lakers players smile
The smile was on every player's face, but the regular season schedule continued. The Lakers returned to Staples Center to face the challenging Timberwolves. Before the start of the game, several players of the Timberwolves were in doubt, but Wiggins, Downes and Teague were not absent. As a result, there will be as many as five top scorers in the game, which is quite attractive to the fans.
After the start of the game, the two sides speeded up to attack each other, and the score rose very fast. Anthony Davis became the Lakers' strongest stable point, and the Timberwolves couldn't prevent the Lakers' attack. The Timberwolves outside feel hot, but in Davis's eye-catching performance, the Lakers still slightly dominate the game. The Timberwolves can't do anything about it. Their defense is nothing in front of Davis.

Anthony Davis 
Davis's first quarter of the game to kill all four firepower open, a single game 10 out of 8 cut 19 points 3 rebounds and 3 assists. Davis joined the Lakers after the performance is very good, attack and defense both sides have a dominant play. The Lakers can play today's record, Anthony Davis plays a crucial role in the team, and Davis is also considered to have the opportunity to compete for MVP and DPOY players.
Davis, who played the first quarter of the game, had a rest at the beginning of the second quarter, but James personally fouled too much, so Davis could only carry the team forward. James went straight back to the dressing room after being called off for his fourth individual foul, and the game was left to Davis. Davies did not fail to live up to expectations. He showed his ability at the offensive end and scored 27 points in half-time.

James made four in the half
In the second quarter, the Lakers were once overtaken by Timberwolves, but under the strong attack of Anthony Davis, the Lakers still regained the lead before the end of the half-time game. But for the Lakers, the second half, especially the third quarter, will be more difficult because of James's foul. Anthony Davies is full of firepower in this game. What kind of scoring performance can he make in the second half?
