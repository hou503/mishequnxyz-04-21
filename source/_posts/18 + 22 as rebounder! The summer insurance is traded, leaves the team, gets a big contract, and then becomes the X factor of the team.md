In the game of clippers vs. walkers, the feeling of walkers in the home game seems to be frozen, and the shooting feeling cannot be found in the whole game. Although the last game had the most behind 24 points difference close to 7 points, but still because of the shooting handle problem, finally suffered a defeat. The Pacers lost 99-110 at home, winning 1-2 in the last three games. The only victory was against the Knicks, and they won by only one point.
What does this mean? The Pacers are not in a good condition. They have not performed badly so far this season, but with the progress of the season, they are inevitably tired. In the game against clippers, only 35.4% of the team's 34 out of 96 shots and 28.6% of the team's three-point goal. Is the Clippers really so good at defending? In fact, the Pacers lost a lot of empty shots, the problem is their own body.

George revisited the old place
When Paul George returned to his hometown, the fans greeted the former team leader with hiss, which made Paul George not adapt at the beginning of the game. He shot all the outside shots for four times in a row. The bad hand feeling of the Pacers made the game become a performance of playing iron, and they failed to seize the opportunity to gain the leading edge. The Pacers "practice both inside and outside" until they missed the home basket.
When the Clippers found the feeling of shooting, the Pacers' trouble came completely, which also led to the Pacers' falling behind almost the whole game. In the last quarter, it was too late to launch a counterattack, and the Pacers could only accept the result of the defeat. The Pacers lost the game, and the efforts of little saberness were wiped out. He scored 18 points, 22 rebounds and 4 assists in the whole game.
Of all the starters of the Pacers, only little saberness has a positive or negative value of + 14, while others have a negative value. Plus or minus 14 is also the highest in the team. When little saberness is on the court, his threat is obviously very big.

Little saberness dunk
On the attack, there are not many highlights of little saberness, only one follow-up of the buckle is more eye-catching. However, don't think that little saberness is not tough enough, because the outside shooting can't find the feeling, the Pacers' inside attack is very difficult. Little saberness scored 18 points in the whole game, second only to Brogden. Little saberness's energy was mainly focused on rebounding. He grabbed the highest 22 rebounds in his career in this game.
Little saberness has been underestimated since he entered the league. After being selected by the magic team, he was packed and traded with orladibo to the thunder team, and then packed with orladibo and sent to the Pacers team. The Pacers have another inside player, miles Turner, so little saberness is facing a lot of competition. When sabonis's contract expires with one year left, the Pacers once considered trading him out because they couldn't negotiate a renewal.
The Pacers finally completed the early renewal with sambonis Jr. and he became the seventh rookie in 2016 to complete the early renewal. What he got was a four-year contract of 74.9 million US dollars - if combined with the bonus, the total value of the contract could reach 85 million US dollars. Little saberness has got a big contract. How will the new season change?

Little saberness grabs rebounds
The biggest change is that sambonis Jr. has become a stable starting player of the team, and has formed a double tower team with miles Turner. Little saberness not only made it to the starting line-up, but also got more playing time. When miles Turner's condition declined, little saberness held up the team's lost foot. This season, little saberness can contribute 18.4 points and 13.5 rebounds per game, and become a rebounder.
With 22 rebounds against clippers and double rebounds in 17 of his last 18 games, little saberness's excellent rebounding ability made him ranked third in the league. Little saberness has made great progress in the new season, which surprises the Pacers' management. Of course, they know the value of little saberness. In the summer, the chips for seeking a deal are not low, so they failed to complete the deal.
The early renewal of the young saberness will not let the team lose the potential stock in the summer of 2020 at least. Now the young saberness has performed so well, which obviously can provide more space for the follow-up operation of the Pacers.
